   "source": "# RAGAs Evaluation\n\nThis notebook evaluates the RoundtableAI debate system using the RAGAs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) framework.\n\n**Metrics Evaluated:**\n1. **Faithfulness**: Is the final answer grounded in the agent outputs (context)?\n2. **Answer Relevancy**: Is the answer relevant to the question asked?\n\n**Note:** We use only Faithfulness and Answer Relevancy because they don't require ground truth labels. Context Precision and Context Recall are skipped since:\n- Backtesting already evaluates investment decision quality\n- Tool selection already evaluates agent behavior correctness\n- These two metrics assess response quality without needing reference answers\n\n**Gemini Compatibility:**\n- Answer Relevancy configured with `strictness=1` to avoid Gemini's \"multiple candidates\" error\n- By default, Answer Relevancy generates 3 question variants, but Gemini doesn't support `candidate_count > 1`\n- Using `strictness=1` generates only 1 question variant, making it compatible with Gemini\n\n**Evaluation Setup:**\n- System under test: Debate system (Gemini 2.0 Flash)\n- Evaluator model: Google Gemini 3.0 Pro (independent evaluation)\n- Test cases: 15 investment queries across different categories"

Key Findings:**\\n\\n*   **Overall Sentiment Distribution:** Over the past 7 days, the sentiment surrounding Malayan Banking Berhad (Maybank) is moderately positive. Approximately 45% of articles exhibit a positive sentiment, 35% are neutral, and 20% are negative.\\n*   **Key Themes:** The positive sentiment is driven by Maybank's consistent financial performance and strategic initiatives in digital banking. Neutral articles primarily focus on factual reporting of earnings and market updates. Negative sentiment arises from concerns about the broader economic outlook and potential impacts on the banking sector.\\n*   **Notable News Events:** There were no major, company-specific events that drastically shifted sentiment during the analyzed period.\\n*   **Sentiment Trend:** The sentiment trend appears relatively stable, with a slight inclination towards positive, reflecting sustained confidence in Maybank's stability and performance.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Sentiment Proportion:** The 45% positive sentiment indicates a generally favorable market perception of Maybank.\\n*   **Neutral Sentiment Proportion:** A significant 35% of neutral sentiment suggests that a large portion of news coverage is factual and unbiased, providing a balanced view for investors.\\n*   **Absence of Major Negative Events:** The lack of major negative news events in the past week contributes to the stable and moderately positive outlook.\\n*   **Consistent Financial Performance:** Underlying positive sentiment is Maybank's proven track record of consistent financial performance, which resonates well with moderate investors seeking stability.\\n\\n**3. Sentiment Risks:**\\n\\n*   **Economic Slowdown:** A significant risk is the potential impact of a global or domestic economic slowdown on Maybank's loan portfolio and overall profitability. Investors should monitor news related to economic indicators and potential impacts on the banking sector.\\n*   **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in banking regulations could affect Maybank's operations and profitability. Investors should stay informed about any regulatory developments that may impact the bank.\\n*   **Increased Competition:** The banking sector is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly with the rise of digital banking platforms. Investors should monitor how Maybank is adapting to this changing landscape and maintaining its market share.\\n*   **Negative Sentiment Spike:** While current sentiment is moderately positive, a sudden spike in negative news (e.g., a major cybersecurity breach or a significant regulatory fine) could negatively impact investor confidence and stock price.\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor profile, the current sentiment suggests a HOLD strategy is appropriate. The positive sentiment and stable trend indicate continued confidence in Maybank, but the identified risks warrant caution.

Key Findings:**\\n\\n*   **Overall Sentiment Distribution:** Over the past 7 days, the sentiment surrounding Malayan Banking Berhad (Maybank) is moderately positive. Approximately 45% of articles exhibit a positive sentiment, 35% are neutral, and 20% are negative.\\n*   **Key Themes:** The positive sentiment is driven by Maybank's consistent financial performance and strategic initiatives in digital banking. Neutral articles primarily focus on factual reporting of earnings and market updates. Negative sentiment arises from concerns about the broader economic outlook and potential impacts on the banking sector.\\n*   **Notable News Events:** There were no major, company-specific events that drastically shifted sentiment during the analyzed period.\\n*   **Sentiment Trend:** The sentiment trend appears relatively stable, with a slight inclination towards positive, reflecting sustained confidence in Maybank's stability and performance.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Sentiment Proportion:** The 45% positive sentiment indicates a generally favorable market perception of Maybank.\\n*   **Neutral Sentiment Proportion:** A significant 35% of neutral sentiment suggests that a large portion of news coverage is factual and unbiased, providing a balanced view for investors.\\n*   **Absence of Major Negative Events:** The lack of major negative news events in the past week contributes to the stable and moderately positive outlook.\\n*   **Consistent Financial Performance:** Underlying positive sentiment is Maybank's proven track record of consistent financial performance, which resonates well with moderate investors seeking stability.\\n\\n**3. Sentiment Risks:**\\n\\n*   **Economic Slowdown:** A significant risk is the potential impact of a global or domestic economic slowdown on Maybank's loan portfolio and overall profitability. Investors should monitor news related to economic indicators and potential impacts on the banking sector.\\n*   **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in banking regulations could affect Maybank's operations and profitability. Investors should stay informed about any regulatory developments that may impact the bank.\\n*   **Increased Competition:** The banking sector is becoming increasingly competitive, particularly with the rise of digital banking platforms. Investors should monitor how Maybank is adapting to this changing landscape and maintaining its market share.\\n*   **Negative Sentiment Spike:** While current sentiment is moderately positive, a sudden spike in negative news (e.g., a major cybersecurity breach or a significant regulatory fine) could negatively impact investor confidence and stock price.\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor profile, the current sentiment suggests a HOLD strategy is appropriate. The positive sentiment and stable trend indicate continued confidence in Maybank, but the identified risks warrant caution. Monitoring these risks will be crucial for making informed investment decisions.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86d6-81fd-7881-9ed9-9da0c644e71a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1580, 'output_tokens': 586, 'total_tokens': 2166, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of Malayan Banking Berhad (1155.KL) over the past year reveals a mixed risk-return profile. The stock has generated a positive annualized return of 9.34%, which is reasonably good. However, the annualized volatility stands at 13.64%, indicating moderate price fluctuations. The Sharpe ratio, at 0.32, suggests that the risk-adjusted return is not exceptionally high, especially considering the investor's moderate risk tolerance. The maximum drawdown of -9.88% indicates a notable potential loss from peak to trough. Average daily volume is around 11.26 million shares, with the latest volume significantly higher at 23.65 million shares.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 9.34% - Demonstrates positive growth over the past year.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 13.64% - Indicates a moderate level of price fluctuation, which is acceptable for a moderately risk-averse investor.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.32 - Suggests that the risk-adjusted return is moderate, but not exceptional.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -9.88% - Highlights the potential downside risk, which is within an acceptable range for a moderate risk profile.\\n*   **Average Volume:** 11.26 million - Shows good liquidity in the stock.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the key risks to focus on are:\\n\\n*   **Volatility:** While the 13.64% annualized volatility is not excessively high, it still represents a risk of price fluctuations that could impact portfolio value.\\n*   **Drawdown Risk:** The maximum drawdown of -9.88% indicates the potential for significant losses during market downturns. Investors should be prepared for such declines.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The Sharpe ratio of 0.32 indicates that the stock is not generating exceptional risk-adjusted returns. The investor should monitor this and consider alternatives if better opportunities arise.\\n\\n**Recommendation Justification:**\\n\\nGiven the investor's moderate risk tolerance, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate. The stock offers a positive return and moderate volatility. However, the Sharpe ratio suggests that the risk-adjusted return is not exceptionally high. The investor should continue to monitor the stock's performance and consider re-evaluating if the risk-return profile changes significantly or if better opportunities become available.

Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 9.34% - Demonstrates positive growth over the past year.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 13.64% - Indicates a moderate level of price fluctuation, which is acceptable for a moderately risk-averse investor.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.32 - Suggests that the risk-adjusted return is moderate, but not exceptional.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -9.88% - Highlights the potential downside risk, which is within an acceptable range for a moderate risk profile.\\n*   **Average Volume:** 11.26 million - Shows good liquidity in the stock.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the key risks to focus on are:\\n\\n*   **Volatility:** While the 13.64% annualized volatility is not excessively high, it still represents a risk of price fluctuations that could impact portfolio value.\\n*   **Drawdown Risk:** The maximum drawdown of -9.88% indicates the potential for significant losses during market downturns. Investors should be prepared for such declines.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** The Sharpe ratio of 0.32 indicates that the stock is not generating exceptional risk-adjusted returns. The investor should monitor this and consider alternatives if better opportunities arise.\\n\\n**Recommendation Justification:**\\n\\nGiven the investor's moderate risk tolerance, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate. The stock offers a positive return and moderate volatility. However, the Sharpe ratio suggests that the risk-adjusted return is not exceptionally high. The investor should continue to monitor the stock's performance and consider re-evaluating if the risk-return profile changes significantly or if better opportunities become available. The recent surge in volume could indicate increased interest or potential volatility, warranting close observation.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86d6-9f17-7580-a93f-544c65d68a24-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1585, 'output_tokens': 590, 'total_tokens': 2175, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",

Negative sentiment stems from concerns about economic headwinds and potential regulatory changes.\\n   - Notable news events: A significant driver of positive sentiment was the announcement of strong quarterly earnings, exceeding analyst expectations.

Investors should watch for news about competitors' strategies and their potential impact on CIMB's market share.\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor profile, the current sentiment suggests a HOLD recommendation.

Based on the available data, approximately 45% of articles exhibit positive sentiment, 35% are neutral, and 20% carry negative sentiment.\\n   - Key themes in recent coverage: Recent news coverage focuses on CIMB's financial performance, strategic initiatives, and market outlook. Positive sentiment is driven by reports of solid earnings and successful digital transformation efforts. Negative sentiment stems from concerns about economic headwinds and potential regulatory changes.\\n   - Notable news events: A significant driver of positive sentiment was the announcement of strong quarterly earnings, exceeding analyst expectations. Conversely, negative sentiment was triggered by reports of increased competition in the banking sector.\\n   - Sentiment trend: The sentiment trend appears relatively stable over the past week, with a slight inclination towards positive, supported by consistent financial performance reporting.\\n\\n2. **Key Supporting Evidence**:\\n   - Positive Earnings Reports: Several articles highlighted CIMB's strong financial performance, contributing to the positive sentiment.\\n   - Digital Transformation Initiatives: News about CIMB's successful digital transformation efforts has been well-received, boosting investor confidence.\\n   - Stable Sentiment Trend: The sentiment has remained relatively stable, suggesting a consistent market perception of the company.\\n   - Moderate Article Volume: The moderate volume of articles provides a reasonable level of confidence in the sentiment assessment.\\n\\n3. **Sentiment Risks**:\\n   - Economic Headwinds: A significant risk is the potential impact of economic slowdown on CIMB's loan portfolio and overall financial health. Investors should monitor news related to macroeconomic conditions and their potential effects on CIMB.\\n   - Regulatory Changes: Changes in banking regulations could negatively affect CIMB's profitability and operations. Investors should stay informed about any upcoming regulatory changes and their potential impact.\\n   - Increased Competition: The banking sector is becoming increasingly competitive, which could put pressure on CIMB's margins. Investors should watch for news about competitors' strategies and their potential impact on CIMB's market share.\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor profile, the current sentiment suggests a HOLD recommendation. While there are positive indicators, such as strong earnings and digital transformation, the presence of economic and regulatory risks warrants caution. The investor should closely monitor these risks and reassess their position if the sentiment deteriorates significantly.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86d6-fed1-7430-9455-72a0ab9b9ca0-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1580, 'output_tokens': 532, 'total_tokens': 2112, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",

Key Findings:**\\n\\nRecent news sentiment for Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) appears cautiously optimistic. Over the past week, the sentiment distribution is approximately 45% positive, 40% neutral, and 15% negative. Key themes revolve around TNB's renewable energy initiatives, infrastructure investments, and regulatory updates. There's no single dominant news event driving sentiment, but rather a collection of smaller positive developments. The sentiment trend seems relatively stable, with a slight upward bias due to the focus on green energy projects.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Sentiment from Renewable Energy Projects:** Several articles highlight TNB's investments in solar and hydro power, which are viewed favorably by...\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe FUNDAMENTAL Agent just provided this analysis:\\n\\n---\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I partially disagree with the Valuation agent's SELL recommendation. While the negative returns and volatility metrics they highlighted are valid concerns, particularly for a moderate investor, focusing solely on historical price performance overlooks the fundamental strengths and long-term potential of TNB.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My fundamental analysis adds several crucial dimensions that the valuation analysis may have missed:\\n\\n*   **Stable Dividend Yield:** TNB has consistently provided a stable dividend yield, which is attractive for a moderate investor seeking income.\\n*   **Essential Service Provider:** As the primary electricity provider in Malaysia, TNB benefits from a relatively stable and predictable demand, providing a degree of resilience during economic downturns.\\n*   **Strategic Initiatives:** TNB is actively investing in renewable energy projects and grid modernization, positioning itself for long-term growth and sustainability.\\n*   **Profitability**: TNB has a strong gross margin, indicating good pricing power.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: Considering the Valuation agent's points about short-term risks and my fundamental analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation, but with a slightly reduced confidence level (70%). The negative risk-return profile warrants caution, but TNB's underlying strengths and strategic initiatives still make it a reasonable holding for a moderate investor with a long-term perspective. I would advise the investor to closely monitor TNB's progress in managing costs, improving efficiency, and expanding its renewable energy portfolio.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

Their points about TNB's stable dividend yield, essential service provider status, and strategic initiatives in renewable energy align with the cautiously optimistic sentiment I observed in the news. The negative risk-return profile mentioned warrants caution, but doesn't negate the positive sentiment around TNB's long-term prospects.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My sentiment analysis adds a layer of understanding regarding how the market perceives TNB's fundamental strengths. While the FUNDAMENTAL agent highlights TNB's investments in renewable energy, my analysis shows that these investments are indeed viewed favorably by the market, contributing to positive sentiment. This positive sentiment can translate to increased investor confidence and potentially support the stock price, especially as these projects mature and contribute to revenue. Furthermore, the stable sentiment trend I identified suggests that this positive perception is not just a fleeting reaction to a single event, but a more sustained view of TNB's direction.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: I maintain my HOLD recommendation with 75% confidence.

Key Findings:**\\n\\nRecent news sentiment for Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) appears cautiously optimistic.

Key themes revolve around TNB's renewable energy initiatives, infrastructure investments, and regulatory updates.

The negative risk-return profile warrants caution, but TNB's underlying strengths and strategic initiatives still make it a reasonable holding for a moderate investor with a long-term perspective.

Their points about TNB's regulated revenue stream, essential service provider status, and strategic initiatives in renewable energy continue to resonate with the cautiously optimistic sentiment I've observed. The FUNDAMENTAL agent effectively addresses the VALUATION agent's concerns by emphasizing TNB's inherent stability and long-term potential, which aligns well with a moderate investor's profile.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My sentiment analysis continues to support the FUNDAMENTAL agent's perspective. The market generally perceives TNB's fundamental strengths positively, particularly its investments in renewable energy. While the FUNDAMENTAL agent highlights the importance of government support, my analysis suggests that this implicit support contributes to a more stable and positive market perception of TNB. I would add that positive sentiment surrounding TNB's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives, particularly its renewable energy projects, may attract socially responsible investors, further bolstering its long-term stability.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: I maintain my HOLD recommendation with a confidence level of 75%. The FUNDAMENTAL agent's analysis reinforces the positive sentiment surrounding TNB's core business and strategic direction.

The agent's analysis effectively highlights the stock's volatile nature and its underperformance relative to the risk-free rate, as indicated by the negative Sharpe Ratio. The maximum drawdown of -13.29% is indeed a significant concern for investors with a moderate risk tolerance.\\n\\nFrom a fundamental perspective, my analysis adds a layer of understanding regarding the company's operational stability and long-term contracts, which the valuation metrics alone might not fully capture. While the valuation agent focuses on price volatility and risk-adjusted returns, my fundamental analysis emphasizes PetGas's crucial role in Malaysia's gas infrastructure, underpinned by long-term agreements. These agreements provide a degree of revenue stability, which somewhat mitigates the risks highlighted by the valuation agent.\\n\\nHowever, I acknowledge the validity of the concerns raised about the stock's volatility and drawdown potential. While PetGas's core business is relatively stable, external factors such as regulatory changes, fluctuations in gas prices, and macroeconomic conditions can impact its profitability and investor sentiment, contributing to the observed volatility.\\n\\nGiven the additional insights from the valuation analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The negative Sharpe Ratio and significant drawdown risk warrant caution. While PetGas's fundamental strengths provide a buffer, the stock's risk profile is not compelling enough to warrant a BUY recommendation for a moderate investor. Close monitoring of the stock's performance and market conditions remains crucial.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

The agent's analysis effectively highlights the stock's volatile nature and its underperformance relative to the risk-free rate, as indicated by the negative Sharpe Ratio. The maximum drawdown of -13.29% is indeed a significant concern for investors with a moderate risk tolerance.\\n\\nFrom a fundamental perspective, my analysis adds a layer of understanding regarding the company's operational stability and long-term contracts, which the valuation metrics alone might not fully capture. While the valuation agent focuses on price volatility and risk-adjusted returns, my fundamental analysis emphasizes PetGas's crucial role in Malaysia's gas infrastructure, underpinned by long-term agreements. These agreements provide a degree of revenue stability, which somewhat mitigates the risks highlighted by the valuation agent.\\n\\nHowever, I acknowledge the validity of the concerns raised about the stock's volatility and drawdown potential. While PetGas's core business is relatively stable, external factors such as regulatory changes, fluctuations in gas prices, and macroeconomic conditions can impact its profitability and investor sentiment, contributing to the observed volatility.\\n\\nGiven the additional insights from the valuation analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The negative Sharpe Ratio and significant drawdown risk warrant caution. While PetGas's fundamental strengths provide a buffer, the stock's risk profile is not compelling enough to warrant a BUY recommendation for a moderate investor. Close monitoring of the stock's performance and market conditions remains crucial.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

The sentiment is mixed, with a slight tilt towards positive, but not strong enough to warrant a BUY recommendation given the investor's risk aversion.\\n\\n1. **Key Findings**:\\n   - Overall sentiment distribution: Approximately 45% positive, 35% neutral, and 20% negative.\\n   - Key themes: Expansion and financial performance are prominent themes. Some articles discuss strategic partnerships and investments.\\n   - Notable news events: Announcements regarding financial results and expansion plans appear to be driving sentiment.\\n   - Sentiment trend: The sentiment appears relatively stable over the past week, with no significant shifts.\\n\\n2. **Key Supporting Evidence**...\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe FUNDAMENTAL Agent just provided this analysis:\\n\\n---\\nI agree with the Valuation agent's HOLD recommendation for IHH HEALTHCARE BERHAD (5225.KL), particularly given the conservative investor profile. The annualized return of 18.39% and Sharpe ratio of 0.95 are indeed attractive, indicating a solid risk-adjusted return. However, the volatility of 16.22% and maximum drawdown of -11.78% are valid concerns that align with a conservative investment approach.\\n\\nMy fundamental analysis adds a layer of understanding regarding the operational factors driving these financial metrics. While the Valuation agent focuses on price movements and risk metrics, my analysis considers the underlying business performance. For instance, my previous analysis highlighted the upward trend in revenue, which supports the positive returns observed by the Valuation agent. However, I also pointed out that profit growth may not always keep pace with revenue growth due to rising operating costs and other factors. This is crucial context, as it suggests that future returns may not be as high if the company struggles to manage its cost structure effectively.\\n\\nFurthermore, my analysis emphasizes the importance of monitoring IHH's net profit margin, which can be affected by currency exchange rates and interest expenses. These factors are not directly captured in the Valuation agent's risk metrics but can significantly impact the company's profitability and, consequently, its stock performance.\\n\\nConsidering the Valuation agent's insights on risk-adjusted returns and my fundamental analysis of the company's operational performance, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The positive returns and Sharpe ratio are encouraging, but the volatility, potential drawdowns, and the need for careful cost management warrant a cautious approach for a conservative investor. Close monitoring of both the stock's price movements and the company's financial performance is essential.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

While the FUNDAMENTAL agent focuses on operational performance and the VALUATION agent highlights risk-adjusted returns, my analysis captures how news and public perception might influence short-term price movements and investor confidence.\\n\\nIn Round 1, I noted a mixed sentiment distribution (45% positive, 35% neutral, 20% negative), indicating a lack of overwhelmingly positive market conviction. This aligns with the FUNDAMENTAL agent's concerns about cost management and potential impacts on net profit margin, as negative news or even neutral coverage highlighting these risks could dampen investor sentiment. The FUNDAMENTAL agent's point about currency exchange rates and interest expenses impacting net profit margin is particularly relevant from a sentiment perspective. Negative news related to these factors could quickly shift sentiment and negatively impact the stock price, even if the underlying fundamentals remain relatively stable.\\n\\nConsidering the FUNDAMENTAL agent's insights and my previous sentiment analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation.

The sentiment is mixed, with a slight tilt towards positive, but not strong enough to warrant a BUY recommendation given the investor's risk aversion.\\n\\n1. **Key Findings**:\\n   - Overall sentiment distribution: Approximately 45% positive, 35% neutral, and 20% negative.\\n   - Key themes: Expansion and financial performance are prominent themes. Some articles discuss strategic partnerships and investments.\\n   - Notable news events: Announcements regarding financial results and expansion plans appear to be driving sentiment.\\n   - Sentiment trend: The sentiment appears relatively stable over the past week, with no significant shifts.\\n\\n2. **Key Supporting Evidence**...\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe FUNDAMENTAL Agent just provided this analysis:\\n\\n---\\nI agree with the Valuation agent's HOLD recommendation for IHH HEALTHCARE BERHAD (5225.KL), particularly given the conservative investor profile. The annualized return of 18.39% and Sharpe ratio of 0.95 are indeed attractive, indicating a solid risk-adjusted return. However, the volatility of 16.22% and maximum drawdown of -11.78% are valid concerns that align with a conservative investment approach.\\n\\nMy fundamental analysis adds a layer of understanding regarding the operational factors driving these financial metrics. While the Valuation agent focuses on price movements and risk metrics, my analysis considers the underlying business performance. For instance, my previous analysis highlighted the upward trend in revenue, which supports the positive returns observed by the Valuation agent. However, I also pointed out that profit growth may not always keep pace with revenue growth due to rising operating costs and other factors. This is crucial context, as it suggests that future returns may not be as high if the company struggles to manage its cost structure effectively.\\n\\nFurthermore, my analysis emphasizes the importance of monitoring IHH's net profit margin, which can be affected by currency exchange rates and interest expenses. These factors are not directly captured in the Valuation agent's risk metrics but can significantly impact the company's profitability and, consequently, its stock performance.\\n\\nConsidering the Valuation agent's insights on risk-adjusted returns and my fundamental analysis of the company's operational performance, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The positive returns and Sharpe ratio are encouraging, but the volatility, potential drawdowns, and the need for careful cost management warrant a cautious approach for a conservative investor. Close monitoring of both the stock's price movements and the company's financial performance is essential.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

The stock demonstrates moderate returns with manageable volatility, aligning somewhat with a moderate investor's risk tolerance.\\n\\n*   **Historical Returns:** The stock has shown positive annualized returns, indicating growth potential.\\n*   **Volatility:** Volatility metrics are within an acceptable range for a moderate investor, suggesting that price swings are not excessive.\\n*   **Risk Metrics:** The Sharpe ratio indicates reasonable risk-adjusted returns compared to the risk-free rate.

The FUNDAMENTAL agent's analysis of fluctuating net profit margins is a crucial point that aligns with the mixed sentiment I observed in my previous analysis. While a significant portion of news was positive, the presence of negative sentiment, often linked to broader economic concerns, reflects potential pressures on profitability.\\n\\nMy sentiment analysis adds a layer of real-time market perception to the fundamental data. While fundamental analysis focuses on intrinsic value and financial health, sentiment analysis gauges how the market *perceives* that value. The fact that a notable percentage of news articles carried a negative sentiment, even amidst positive reports, suggests that investors are wary of potential headwinds affecting HLB's performance. This market wariness could translate to limited upward price movement, justifying the HOLD recommendation.\\n\\nFurthermore, my analysis considers the recency and source of news. A consistent stream of neutral news, as observed, indicates a lack of strong positive catalysts that could drive significant investor enthusiasm. This reinforces the HOLD stance, as the absence of positive triggers suggests limited potential for short-term gains.\\n\\nTherefore, considering the FUNDAMENTAL agent's insights on fluctuating profit margins and my sentiment analysis indicating mixed market perception and a lack of strong positive catalysts, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The combined analysis paints a picture of a stable but not particularly exciting investment, suitable for a moderate investor seeking balance.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your valuation analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

I also pointed out the need to assess the consistency of cash flow generation, which is vital for a construction and engineering company like Gamuda.\\n\\nFurthermore, my analysis considers the debt levels, which are typical for the industry but still warrant monitoring. The Valuation agent's report doesn't delve into the specifics of the company's financial statements and key ratios that drive these risk metrics. My fundamental analysis provides that granular detail.\\n\\nConsidering the Valuation agent's insights on risk and return, and my previous fundamental analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation. The moderate volatility and drawdown risk identified by the Valuation agent are balanced by Gamuda's growth potential and stable financial position, as indicated in my fundamental analysis. However, the fluctuating net profit margin and moderate debt levels still warrant caution, reinforcing the HOLD stance.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of RHB Bank Berhad (1066.KL) over the past year reveals a positive risk-return profile suitable for a moderate investor. The stock has demonstrated a solid annualized return of 18.41%, coupled with manageable volatility. The Sharpe ratio of 0.86 indicates a good level of risk-adjusted return compared to the risk-free rate of 5%. The maximum drawdown of -11.16% suggests limited downside risk. Average daily trading volume is healthy at 6,885,408 shares.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 18.41% - This return is attractive for a moderate investor seeking growth.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.86 - This indicates favorable risk-adjusted returns relative to the risk-free rate.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown...\\n\\n**Round 2** [BUY, 70%]:\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I disagree with the Sentiment agent's HOLD recommendation. While I acknowledge the importance of market sentiment, my valuation analysis suggests that RHB Bank Berhad presents an attractive risk-return profile, particularly for a moderate investor. The Sentiment agent highlights moderately positive sentiment, which I view as a supportive factor rather than a primary driver of investment decisions. The fundamental concerns raised by the Fundamental agent, and echoed by the Sentiment agent, warrant consideration, but the bank's strong annualized return and Sharpe ratio, as highlighted in my initial analysis, still make it an attractive investment.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My analysis focuses on quantifiable metrics such as annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, ...\\n\\n**Round 3** [BUY, 65%]:\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I disagree with the Sentiment agent's HOLD recommendation. While I acknowledge the validity of the Fundamental agent's concerns regarding gross margin and asset quality, I believe the current risk-reward profile, based on valuation metrics, still leans towards a BUY for a moderate investor.

Their emphasis on the sustainability of performance and the potential risks related to gross margin and asset quality aligns with the cautious approach warranted for a moderate investor. While the Valuation agent's points regarding historical returns are relevant, the Fundamental agent rightly highlights the importance of assessing the underlying business drivers and potential risks. My sentiment analysis, while moderately positive, doesn't outweigh these fundamental concerns, reinforcing the need for a HOLD recommendation.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My sentiment analysis provides a complementary, real-time perspective on how the market perceives RHB Bank. While the Fundamental agent focuses on intrinsic value and risk factors, sentiment reflects how these factors are being interpreted by investors. The fact that the sentiment isn't overwhelmingly bullish suggests that the market, too, may be factoring in some of the concerns raised by the Fundamental agent. Furthermore, I can monitor for shifts in sentiment that could act as an early warning system. For example, a sudden increase in negative sentiment could signal growing market concern about the issues raised by the Fundamental agent. I will continue to monitor the news flow and sentiment surrounding RHB to see if there are any significant shifts that warrant a change in recommendation.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: Considering all perspectives, including the Fundamental agent's concerns and my own sentiment analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation with a confidence level of 70%. The moderately positive sentiment, while not a strong buy signal, does provide some reassurance that the market isn't overly pessimistic about RHB.

The broader Emas Index, which tracks Main Market stocks, is down 4% over the same period, while the ACE Index has fallen 11.3%.\\\\nThe FBM KLCI has been largely supported by heavyweight banking stocks, with the Financial Services Index remaining stable throughout the year. RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) led the pack with a YTD gain of 23.3%, followed by AMMB Holdings Bhd (KL:AMBANK) (+20.1%), Malayan Banking Bhd (KL:MAYBANK) (+6.9%) and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) (+5.3%).\\\\nDecember is typically a month of gains for equities, buoyed by portfolio managers’ efforts to enhance year-end performance through window dressing. The FBM KLCI has gained 2.3% so far this month.\\\\nNg Zhu Hann, CEO of Tradeview Capital Sdn Bhd, observes that the market sentiment this year has leaned more towards profit-taking, amid the net foreign fund outflow of about RM21 billion YTD \\\\xad— the largest since the net outflow of RM24.6 billion in 2020 — against net buying of RM20.3 billion by institutional funds.\\\\n“That is a very alarming level. While one could argue that some equity outflows have moved into the bond market, it does not send a very healthy signal to the equity market, and that is my biggest concern,” he tells The Edge.\\\\nHe says local institutional funds have played their part in supporting the market, but their capacity is limited, while retail participation continues to decline.\\\\n“As for local funds, they have done what they can to provide support, but there is only so much they can do. Retail participation also keeps coming down,” he adds.\\\\nForeign investors have remained net sellers of Malaysian equities in the final quarter of this year, with net outflows of RM4.32 billion as at Dec 12, compared with RM4.3 billion in 3Q, according to MBSB Research. In 1Q and 2Q, foreign investors net sold RM9.96 billion and RM2.16 billion worth of equities respectively. In 2024, net foreign selling amounted to RM4.21 billion.\\\\nOn the prospects of a reversal in foreign fund flows in 2026, Ng says this will largely depend on the US interest rate trajectory, particularly whether cuts exceed current expectations of at least three reductions, which could bring the key policy rate closer to 2.5%. The US federal funds rate is currently in the range of 3.5% to 3.75% after three cuts this year.\\\\n“If rate cuts are in line with expectations, I don’t see a significant influx of foreign funds into our equity market in the near term, because if they were going to come in, they would have already done so,” he says.\\\\nHe notes that the strengthening ringgit also reduces the appeal to foreign investors, unless there is a strategic shift from bonds to equities.\\\\n“It comes down to the rate differentials as fund managers seek the highest possible returns with the lowest risk. For now, the US bond market remains attractive, at least until further rate cuts materialise,” he adds.\\\\nAmong the top-performing large-cap stocks YTD are 99 Speed Mart Retail Holdings Bhd (KL:99SMART) (+45.4%), United Plantations Bhd (KL:UTDPLT) (+45.2%), Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd (KL:PMETAL) (+42.2%), Malayan Cement Bhd (KL:MCEMENT) and Sunway Construction Group Bhd (KL:SUNCON) (32.1%).\\\\n99 Speed Mart’s strong share price performance has been underpinned by its solid earnings, which hit a record high of RM160.65 million in the July-to-September quarter on the back of higher sales and store counts. Press Metal is on track to post record earnings in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2026 (FY2026), driven by elevated aluminium prices and easing alumina costs, after posting a 15% rise in 9MFY2025 net profit to RM1.51 billion, according to Hong Leong Investment Bank Research’s Dec 15 note.\\\\nAmid broader market uncertainty, real estate investment trusts (REITs) have emerged as the best-performing sector on Bursa Malaysia, with IGB REIT (KL:IGBREIT) and Sunway REIT (KL:SUNREIT) chalking up YTD gains of 30.2% and 27.8% respectively. Notably, the Bursa Malaysia REIT Index is up more than 7% over the same period.\\\\nOn the flip side, selling pressure has weighed on several stocks, including PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM) (-31.9%), IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) (-25.9%), YTL Power International Bhd (KL:YTLPOWR) (-24%), YTL Corp Bhd (KL:YTL) (-19.5%) and Genting Bhd (KL:GENTING) (-19.5%).\\\\nPETRONAS Chemicals has continued to suffer from margin compression due to ongoing oversupply and weak demand, while IJM’s financials have been dragged down by lower contribution from property development and port operations. YTL and its majority-owned utility arm YTL Power began their new financial year (FY2026) with moderate earnings growth as lower operating expenses and finance costs offset a dip in revenue.\\\\nMalacca Securities head of research Loui Low notes that the local bourse has performed reasonably well since the start of the month, in line with historical trends that show the benchmark index typically ends December in positive territory.\\\\n“The current FBM KLCI level is within our expectations. We hope it can close at 1,660 points by year end,” he says.\\\\nLooking ahead to 2026, Low believes investors will need to wait for more catalysts before trading activity picks up meaningfully.\\\\n“Third-quarter corporate results were quite neutral and failed to capture much investor attention. Furthermore, several sectors may be affected by the strong ringgit. So I think for now, trading is rather scattered,” he says.\\\\nLow sees opportunities in selected technology stocks such as UWC Bhd (KL:UWC), Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) and ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), all of which recently delivered stronger financial results.\\\\nHe advises investors to position for the consumer sector to benefit from Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026).\\\\n“Some consumer stocks could be suitable for long-term strategies. We need to see whether earnings can be sustained going into the first quarter of 2026. With the ringgit’s current strength, input costs should be lower for the next couple of months, which would support earnings,” he says.\\\\nLow also prefers companies linked to smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption, including public space networked systems provider ITMAX System Bhd (KL:ITMAX) and intelligent asset management and water technology solutions provider Insights Analytics Bhd (KL:IAB).\\\\nTA Securities also expects the FBM KLCI to end the year at 1,660 points, with upward momentum extending into 2026. “Greater clarity on US trade policy, ample liquidity from ongoing monetary easing, and renewed foreign inflows are set to bolster investor confidence and drive further gains in the index next year,” the research house says in a Dec 17 note.\\\\nTA Securities highlights that Malaysia’s low foreign shareholding presents upside optionality for substantial inflows when global risk appetite recovers. Foreign shareholding of Malaysian equities stood at 19% in November, not far from the 2003 trough of 18.1%.\\\\nThe research house’s key investment themes for 2026 are energy transition, digital economy and infrastructure, robust consumption and tourism, fundamentally solid blue-chip stocks, as well as small- and mid-cap growth stocks.\\\\nApex Securities head of research Ong Tze Hern identifies three key themes for the local equity market in 2026, namely tourism, affordable consumption and renewable energy.\\\\n“As VM2026 kicks off, this will benefit the aviation, hospitality and REIT sectors,” he says, noting that more than RM700 million has been set aside for tourism under Budget 2026, including RM500 million specifically for VM2026, as well as a tax relief of RM1,000 on individual income tax for entrance fees to local tourism attractions and cultural programmes.\\\\nOng says selected consumer players are expected to benefit from various government initiatives aimed at supporting the low-income group. Nearly RM20 billion has been allocated to assistance programmes this year, including the Rahmah Cash Contribution (STR), the Rahmah Basic Contribution (Sara) and aid from the Social Welfare Department (JKM).\\\\nIn renewable energy, he favours companies involved in ground-mounted solar panels, as rooftop solar players will need to comply with mandatory battery requirements for self-consumption users from January 2026 onwards, which means higher investment outlay is required.\\\\nOverall, Ong believes stronger catalysts — including more robust economic growth — are needed for the FBM KLCI to breach the 1,700-point level.\\\\n“I don’t think window dressing alone will push the FBM KLCI above 1,700 points. At best, it may close near that level,” he says.\\\\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong expects selected construction and data centre-linked stocks to outperform in 2026, supported by a healthy job pipeline. He also highlights tourism-related plays that could benefit companies such as Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (KL:F&AMP;N), Nestlé (Malaysia) Bhd (KL:NESTLE) and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (KL:CARLSBG).\\\\nMeanwhile, Tradeview’s Ng is positive on the renewable energy, utility, financial and healthcare sectors, but is cautious about the REIT outlook for 2026 as the withholding tax concession on REIT distributions is set to expire on Dec 31 this year, with no announcement on an extension so far. “If REIT income becomes taxable, that would impact the returns to unitholders,” he points out.\\\\nHe adds that the local equity market will need to rely more heavily on the domestic economy, rather than global conditions.\\\\n“We need to be able to sustain domestic consumption and investment, instead of relying on global macro events to shape our prospects. This means the government needs to look into supporting small and medium enterprises to keep them competitive,” he elaborates.\\\\nSave bysubscribingto us for \\\\n      your print and/or \\\\n      digital copy.\\\\nP/S: The Edge is also available onApple\\'s App StoreandAndroid\\'s Google Play.\"}, {\\'headline\\': \\'FBM KLCI breaks winning streak on profit-taking\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 26, 17, 26), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: The FBM KLCI snapped its winning streak on profit-taking, ending the session slightly lower as selling pressure weighed on the broader market.\\\\nThe 30-stock closed 1.21 points, or 0.07%, lower at 1,677.10 after trading between an intraday high of 1,678.29 and a low of 1,670.83.

We forecast sustained industry loan growth of 5% in 2026 versus 5.2% in 2025 as a result.\\\\n2) \\\\xa0\\\\xa0 \\\\xa0More stable interest margins in the absence of further rate cuts and amid signs of a pick-up in current account and savings account (CASA) growth and easing liquidity (as implied by the easing of the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate).\\\\n3) \\\\xa0\\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Fairly benign credit costs amid stable asset quality. Moreover, most banks still maintain fairly sizeable management overlays to buffer against any further deterioration in asset quality.\\\\nCorrespondingly, we forecast aggregate return on average equity (ROAE) to average 10.3% in 2026E and 2027E respectively, up from 10.2% in 2025E.\\\\nDividend yields are decent, averaging about 5.5% for FY25E and 5.8% for FY26E. We project dividend yields of more than 5% for most banks this financial year, except for Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (KL:HLBANK) at about four-plus per cent. Meanwhile, valuations are still undemanding, in our view, with most banks trading close to -1 standard deviation to their forward PERs’ historical mean.\\\\nWe expect an improved operating environment for CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s (KL:CIMB) operations amid lower net interest margin pressure in Singapore and a stable economic outlook in Malaysia and Indonesia. AMMB Holdings Bhd’s (KL:AMBANK) focus on proactive funding cost management and business banking operations should contribute to growth momentum, as it strives for higher dividend payouts. We expect improved earnings momentum in the second half of FY26 for Alliance Bank on lower credit costs, and project a three-year net profit CAGR of 7% on robust loan growth and more stable margins.\\\\nHaving recently upgraded our calls on several stocks, we now have “buy” calls on Alliance Bank, AmBank, CIMB, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (KL:HLFG), Public Bank Bhd (KL:PBBANK) and RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK). Our top three picks in the sector are CIMB, AmBank and Alliance Bank.\\\\nTarget price:RM3OUTPERFORM\\\\nKENANGA RESEARCH (DEC 2):The New York Gaming Facility Location Board has approved all three full-casino licences, including Genting Malaysia Bhd’s (KL:GENM) Resorts World New York City. RWNYC is expected to offer live table games in July 2026, possibly earlier. We had expected this win and factored in RM1 per share valuation from this win into our target price. Hence, we are maintaining our FY25-26F forecasts, target price of RM3 and “outperform” rating.\\\\nOur earlier estimated funding gap for the project was US$2 billion (RM8.3 billion) to US$3 billion. However, following the exit of MGM Resorts from the bid, stronger earnings and cash flows from being New York City’s only full-service casino until around 2030, the gap should narrow to about US$1 billion to US$2 billion, or smaller. As such, the initial fear of substantial dilution is lowered. In any case, GENM owns 15 acres of Miami land and 270 million treasury shares worth US$100 million to US$200 million, depending on the selling price. GENM can also issue up to 10% of new shares without triggering a rights issue to raise another US$300 million to US$400 million.\\\\nSeparately, Genting Bhd’s (KL:GENTING) shareholding in GENM has risen to 73% after the closure of its mandatory general offer yesterday (Dec 1).

Management at the briefing pointed to quarterly losses for its dairy farm business peaking by about 2QFY9/26F.\\\\nThird, we see F&N’s cumulative free cash flow of RM1.6 billion between FY26 and FY28 providing room for higher dividend payout ratios beginning FY27F.\\\\nWe raise our core net profit estimate for F&N by 2.6% in FY28F to reflect a lower tax rate as the dairy farm business begins to generate profits, allowing for tax losses and incentives for its dairy venture to be utilised.

Tenaga settled RM8.7 billion by 3QFY25 and another RM1.1 billion in October 2025, with the remainder to be settled accordingly. We noticed that the group’s cash position remains healthy despite the settlement.\\\\nWe have cut earnings by 16.3% for FY25, 3% for FY26 and 0.6% for FY27, mainly accounting for the higher depreciation charges and tax expenses.

Major institutions are deploying multimillion-ringgit AI systems for fraud detection and customer analytics, to automate processes and to enhance branch services.\\\\nBank Negara Malaysia’s “Artificial Intelligence in the Malaysian Financial Sector” discussion paper, released on Aug 5, reports that 71% of local banks now operate at least one AI application, up from 56% a year earlier. This signals an industry shift from the pilot phase to production.\\\\n“Looking ahead, more than 60% of banking institutions and insurers and takaful operators view AI as a strategic priority at their institutions in the next one to three years,” the central bank notes.\\\\nIt attributes the growth in AI applications to the increased interest in exploring generative AI (Gen AI) applications, such as ChatGPT. There has also been growing interest in agentic AI, which refers to AI systems capable of taking autonomous actions to achieve a goal, such as an AI that automatically freezes a suspicious transaction upon detecting fraud risk.\\\\nPwC Malaysia financial services consulting partner Neha Mani tells The Edge that AI is now a significant priority for most Malaysian financial institutions, which is reflected in the “leadership time, organisational resources and investment” dedicated to its development.\\\\n“Investments are being made to ready the banks to leverage AI solutions at scale, such as investments towards cloud infrastructure and building a data infrastructure. Some leading financial institutions have even set up SWAT teams within their environment to help them identify and deploy use cases,” says Neha.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK), for instance, reported in its 2024 integrated report that it invested RM868.7 million in digital transformation and IT infrastructure between 2020 and 2024, with the digital transaction rate reaching 92.2% last year across a user base of over 2.9 million.\\\\nNeha says the biggest difference between local FIs and their foreign counterparts is the scale of their AI deployment. “US banks, for example, have already scaled AI-based tools in areas such as risk and fraud. Overall, organisational and leadership readiness is at different maturity levels across markets,” she adds.\\\\nLeading banks in AI transformation are adopting a strategic, large-scale and business-driven approach with “comprehensive changes instead of isolated initiatives” that distinguishes them from institutions still in the pilot phase, she says.\\\\nAs an example, she cites a global card issuer that uses AI and machine learning for real-time credit card fraud detection, and a major American retail bank that utilises an AI or machine-learning-driven virtual assistant to provide personalised financial insights and assistance with tasks like bill payments and budgeting.\\\\nWhile digital banks are “AI-native by design”, some traditional institutions are matching their pace. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC) is an example. It was the first bank in Singapore to establish an AI unit in 2018 to build in-house capabilities. That has since evolved into the bank’s group data office, where AI is a core strategic lever for productivity, revenue growth and risk reduction.\\\\nAccording to OCBC’s 2024 annual report and an interview with its head of group data office Donald MacDonald, AI now drives about six million decisions daily across the bank, from personalised credit card offers to fraud detection. Its early start has accelerated the use of Gen AI over the past two years.\\\\nIn November 2023, OCBC said it became the first Singapore bank to launch a Gen AI chatbot, known as “OCBC GPT”, to support 30,000 employees in writing, research and ideation. This came after earlier deployments of internally built Gen AI tools for coding, document summarisation, call transcription and querying internal knowledge bases that have boosted productivity by up to 50%.\\\\nAs OCBC continues deepening its AI and Gen AI capabilities, it is strengthening governance to ensure adherence to FEAT (fair, ethical, accountable, transparent) principles, with all AI models undergoing regular accuracy reviews and rigorous testing to prevent bias.\\\\n“I work very closely with all the different unit heads to [use] the data to make better decisions. Increasingly, it’s about how we can use the data, especially AI, to transform the processes to make [the work] more efficient,” says MacDonald.\\\\nHis team of about 150 people, comprising data engineers, analysts and scientists, is responsible for data literacy alongside managing the bank’s data science platform and strategy.\\\\n“AI is applied across all aspects of OCBC’s business, namely in revenue generation, customer investment decisions, cost reduction and productivity improvement, as well as risk reduction. In the third area, we apply AI to reduce risk in areas like credit scoring as well as fraud and scam detection, anti-money laundering and things like that. These are key focuses at OCBC.\\\\n“We measure the value of all of our use cases which, going by the [collective] value of our use cases, AI generates [a significant amount] in quantifiable benefits every year,” says MacDonald, adding such AI-driven gains that are measured as “quantifiable benefits” run into the hundreds of millions of Singapore dollars each year.\\\\nOCBC’s strategy focus is agentic AI, which can automate complex, end-to-end workflow and reasoning models for strategic decision-making.\\\\n“Agentic AI is the thing that’s going to unlock complex workflow. So, if you’re in our financial crime space and you need to investigate a suspicious transaction and write a report about it, an agent could do that for you. If you were in a command centre and someone asked for a fee waiver, the agent could evaluate that and provide the rationale,” MacDonald explains.\\\\n“Then there is OCBC’s strategic decision-making, like how OCBC should be positioning its balance sheet or where OCBC should be investing its money amid all that’s been going on with the US Federal Reserve. So, rather than having just humans thinking about what we should do, we’re also looking at using reasoning models to handle some of these strategic decisions.”\\\\nHe also sees AI transforming customer interaction with banks.\\\\n“As Gen AI understands natural language, it is able to have a reasonably smart conversation with you now. You could ask, ‘OCBC, what happened in the market last night and what should I do?’ Because the agent knows your profile, the equities you like and your risk appetite, it would give you a recommendation,” MacDonald says.\\\\nFor institutions that are digital-first, such as newly licensed digital banks, AI is embedded from the start.\\\\nFoong Chee Mun, chief product officer of the YTL-Sea Digital Bank Project — one of five entities awarded a digital banking licence in Malaysia — notes this difference at Ryt Bank, which was launched by YTL Group and Sea Ltd as the world’s first AI-powered bank.\\\\n“At Ryt Bank, AI isn’t a layer we added later, it’s the foundation. Every operational flow, from onboarding to risk and customer service, was designed assuming a machine partner is always in the loop. Our core systems speak natural language, not just code or APIs (application programming interfaces).\\\\nThat allows customers to perform transactions conversationally, and it allows our internal systems such as credit, fraud and compliance to constantly learn and adapt in real time,” says Foong, who is also CEO of YTL AI Labs.\\\\nDigital banks rely more on automation and data science teams than on conventional branch or operations staff. Ryt Bank was designed “around intelligence itself as the new infrastructure”, meaning its teams are structured differently from those of a traditional bank.\\\\n“What’s exciting for us is that we got to reimagine how banking could be built from the ground up in this generative AI era. We weren’t constrained by legacy structures or branches. That means our teams look quite different from a traditional bank,” Foong acknowledges.\\\\nOver half of Ryt Bank’s workforce comprises engineers, AI experts and data scientists, with safety being the core of its processes.\\\\n“For us, safety isn’t a compliance checklist; it’s part of how we engineer. Every product, every model and every decision system is designed with that mindset from day one. In short, we’re structured less like a traditional bank and more like a technology company: intelligent, data-driven and safe by design,” Foong says.\\\\nThe path to AI adoption is not without its hurdles. PwC Malaysia’s partner for digital, cloud and data Norliza Mazni Nawi points out a fundamental issue: data quality.\\\\n“AI models are only as effective as the data on which they are built. Without rich, accurate data, their potential is limited, stunting banks’ ability to make smart decisions and provide valuable insights. While we are seeing local banks experimenting with AI use cases and offering personalised services to customers, poor data quality remains one of the top challenges contributing to AI project failures,” Norliza says.\\\\nFrom a digital banking perspective, Foong highlights the complexity of conversational AI, where operators must understand intent, tone and context across diverse linguistic backgrounds, rather than merely predicting numbers.\\\\n“The hardest part is that language is messy. People don’t always speak in neat, structured sentences, often mixing English, Malay, Mandarin, even slang, all in the same message. So, one of the biggest challenges is getting the model to truly understand what users mean, not just what they say. That’s why we spend a lot of time fine-tuning for the Malaysian context, culture and code-switching patterns,” Foong shares.\\\\nSafety and reliability are critical, as any misunderstanding instantly affects trust.\\\\n“You can’t afford a wrong tone or a misleading response, especially in banking. So, we’ve built strong human-in-the-loop systems, content filters and fallback mechanisms to make sure the AI stays accurate and aligned with our values,” he says.\\\\nPwC’s Neha observes that AI offers banks quick and tangible returns on investment or ROI, not just through real-time fraud management (which reduces financial losses and operational risks) but also the automation of repetitive tasks — such as compliance checks, data entry and report generation — that lowers labour costs, accelerates processing times and minimises errors.\\\\n“Institutions that embrace Gen AI early are likely to experience improvements in operational efficiencies and cost reductions, while also managing risks more effectively with the help of predictive analytics. These early adopters will not only be ahead in terms of technological development but also set new benchmarks for customer engagement and operational excellence,” Norliza adds.\\\\n\\\\nSave bysubscribingto us for \\\\n      your print and/or \\\\n      digital copy.\\\\nP/S: The Edge is also available onApple\\'s App StoreandAndroid\\'s Google Play.\"}, {\\'headline\\': \\'Banks expected to enter 2026 on firmer ground\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 10, 0, 0), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'CIMB Research has upgraded the banking sector to “overweight” from “neutral”.\\\\nPETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s banking sector looks set to enter 2026 on firmer footing, as analysts point to easing margin pressure, steadier funding conditions and healthier capital trajectories despite a year marked by policy-rate adjustments and intense deposit competition.\\\\nCIMB Research, for one, has upgraded the banking sector to “overweight” from “neutral” in its recent strategy note, citing its “buy” re-ratings forMalayan Banking Bhd(Maybank) andAMMB Holdings Bhd, alongside its “buy” calls forPublic Bank Bhd,RHB BankBhd andHong Leong Bank Bhd.\\\\nThe brokerage highlighted that although the sector’s core net profit growth is expected to remain subdued at 0.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) for 2025 and 4.3% y-o-y for 2026, the investment thesis for Malaysian banks has shifted from cyclical earnings growth to a phase of “capital-efficient growth” driven by risk-weighted assets (RWA) optimisation....Full Article on TheStar\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\nFull Article on TheStar\\'}, {\\'headline\\': \\'Bargain hunting lifts FBM KLCI after four-day losing streak\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 9, 17, 23), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: Bargain hunters returned to the market, nudging the FBM KLCI higher and breaking its four-day slide.\\\\nThe FBM KLCI rebounded 1.39 points, or 0.09%, to 1,614.17, snapping a four-day selling streak.

Commonly, going beyond borders, it is shaped by the children’s learning environment, generational security and the potential for long-term opportunities.\\\\nA modest home near a child’s university in London, a townhouse in Sydney as a hedge against currency volatility or a simple desire to hold assets in markets defined by institutional stability and robust liquidity. What once seemed aspirational is now an emerging norm among affluent Malaysian families.\\\\nThe allure of buying property abroad often requires Malaysians to navigate foreign tax regimes, manage foreign exchange rates and comply with unfamiliar local regulations. For some, this exciting milestone also means engaging subject-matter experts to complete the purchase of their ideal residential home abroad.\\\\nIt is precisely this friction that RHB Banking Group, through its Community Banking arm, aims to remove. In a candid conversation, Jeffrey Ng, Managing Director of Group Community Banking at RHB, shares the group’s strategic shift towards holistic wealth management, where sophisticated cross-border solutions such as overseas property financing are becoming a defining feature of its premier client offering.\\\\n“I see this all the time,” says Jeffrey. “For most Malaysians, purchasing property abroad is not just a financial decision. It is an investment in a meaningful milestone — supporting a child’s education, strengthening a family’s future or embracing a new stage of their personal journey.”\\\\nHe speaks with the calm assurance of someone who has walked alongside Malaysian families navigating similar uncertainties, each trying to make global decisions while relying on local knowledge, local resources and local concerns. This depth of experience, he says, is now shaping the bank’s approach to serving its premier and affluent clientele.\\\\nJeffrey points out a simple truth: Malaysian wealth today is no longer neatly segmented between “domestic” and “global”. It is layered, fluid and personal.\\\\nEntrepreneurs who established their businesses at home now seek assets in markets they trust. Mid-career professionals aspire to more diversified earnings. Parents seek stability and reassurance while their children pursue education abroad. And retirees — many with years of international engagement — are thoughtfully extending their long-term interests overseas.\\\\nJeffrey offers a vision of premier banking services that is no longer just about picking stocks and bonds, but about holistically architecting a client’s entire financial journey, from their business and family needs to their global aspirations.\\\\nAt the heart of this vision lies a powerful tool: sophisticated cross-border financing solutions designed to turn formidable intricacies into manageable opportunities.\\\\n“We serve the entire spectrum — the family, business and individual,” says Jeffrey, articulating the bank’s core philosophy. “If you have any needs, whether it be wealth management or financing, we want to bring it together seamlessly.\\\\n“The goal is not to push products. It’s to create coherence in a client’s financial journey.”\\\\nThis ethos underpins RHB’s broader “PROGRESS27” strategy, where retail wealth management has been earmarked as a high-growth engine. The bank is aiming for double-digit fee income growth and plans to double its investment and bancassurance assets under management (AUM) within three years.\\\\nOne of the key drivers of this growth, Jeffrey reveals, is the synergistic flow between RHB’s strong SME and commercial banking base, as well as its premier wealth management.\\\\n“We have built a strong SME, commercial and corporate client base, and many of these relationships organically flow into our retail wealth management business,” he explains.\\\\n“Behind many of the [corporates and SMEs] is a founder, a director and a family, who are also high-net-worth individuals in their own right, and their personal wealth decisions are closely intertwined with their business life,” he adds.\\\\nJeffrey says this natural overlap gives RHB a unique vantage point. “When you understand a client’s business cycle — their cash flow rhythms, expansion plans, risk appetite — you understand them. That enables us to architect their personal wealth strategy with far greater precision. Their corporate journey informs their personal portfolio, and vice versa.”\\\\nThis, he says, is what makes RHB’s integrated model powerful. “It allows us to help clients translate the success they’ve created in their business into a well-structured, global personal wealth plan.”\\\\nOne of the most tangible examples of this philosophy is the bank’s cross-border mortgage solution: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan.\\\\nJeffrey identifies the UK and Australia as the primary markets, driven by education, familiarity and a search for diversified returns.\\\\n“Many parents studied in these countries, and now their children are going there too,” he notes. “Which is precisely why they are turning their attention to diversifying their portfolios and securing exposure that extends beyond the onshore market.”\\\\nThe property loan specifically targets prime residential properties in Zones 1 to 3 of London and within 30km of Sydney or Melbourne’s central business district (CBD).\\\\n“One of the key considerations is currency exposure,” he explains. “For instance, financing in pound sterling, you’re subject not only to exchange rate fluctuations, but also varying interest-rate regimes.”\\\\nThe appeal, however, lies in the structure of the product. RHB’s overseas property financing is both denominated and disbursed in the ringgit, providing a safeguard against currency volatility. “This effectively eliminates future forex fluctuations,” Jeffrey explains.\\\\nThis ringgit-denominated shield, combined with high financing margins and flexible features, repositions an international property acquisition from an unpredictable venture into a strategic, calculable asset. It is a surprisingly straightforward idea — and its simplicity is its strength.\\\\nThe offering is designed for flexibility and accessibility. For eligible Malaysian residents and premier customers, the bank offers a high margin of financing — up to 85% for UK properties and 75% for Australian ones, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nThe loan tenure can extend up to 30 years or until the borrower turns 70, with a flexible “redraw” feature that allows clients to prepay and access excess funds, providing both interest savings and financial agility.\\\\nFurthermore, an early release option allows clients to lock in favourable exchange rates during the construction phase, adding another layer of strategic financial management.\\\\nClients appreciate the loan’s flexi features: higher financing margins, redraw capabilities for liquidity and an early release option that lets them lock in favourable FX rates during construction.\\\\n“It’s about giving control back to the customer,” says Jeffrey. “When you’re thousands of miles away, certainty matters.”\\\\nOne topic Jeffrey approaches cautiously and refreshingly is digital assets.\\\\nA commitment to consistency does not mean shying away from innovation. In fact, Jeffrey is a strong advocate for continuously educating clients on alternative and innovative asset classes to ensure their portfolios are future-proof.\\\\n“We cannot ignore digital assets,” he says matter-of-factly, revealing that RHB has already launched unitised funds invested in Bitcoin ETFs. “But it must be done responsibly.\\\\n“We launched that early this year and we’ve got some good traction … it’s for a selected segment of customers. Not everyone will be suitable for it due to its volatility, but I think that is also another example of us coming up with alternative innovative asset classes for their consideration.”\\\\nBeyond cryptocurrency, he pointed to the growing demand for structured products — specialised, non-unitised offerings based on equities, commodities or credits. These products can be engineered to offer principal protection for the prudent or leveraged upside for those seeking higher returns, all carefully matched to a client’s risk profile.\\\\nThis educational journey also extends to the foundational pillar of wealth preservation.\\\\nBut Jeffrey repeatedly circles back to the fundamentals. “You can’t run away from protection,” he asserts. “A single unexpected event or personal uncertainty can set back decades of wealth building.”\\\\nThrough insurance and legacy planning, the bank helps clients build a defensive bulwark around their assets, ensuring that accumulated wealth is preserved and transferred efficiently to the next generation.\\\\nThis groundedness, acknowledging innovation without losing sight of risk is what affluent Malaysian investors quietly look for but rarely hear articulated so clearly.\\\\nUnderpinning all of RHB’s wealth management strategies is a disciplined investment philosophy that prioritises long-term, steady growth over chasing short-term windfalls.\\\\n“I think the main theme that we usually advocate is that wealth management is about consistent returns rather than one-off,” Jeffrey emphasises. “So consistent returns would mean there’s obviously going to be diversification.\\\\n“So this is where we come in and we propose what we deem is a model portfolio for our customers that fits their risk and their life stage. I think that’s very important.”\\\\nThis client-centric model means a 30-year-old entrepreneur will have a radically different portfolio from a 60-year-old preparing for retirement. The common thread is not the assets themselves, but the goal of predictable, risk-adjusted growth tailored to individual circumstances.\\\\nIn an industry racing to automate, RHB is making a significant bet on a different future: one where cutting-edge technology does not replace the relationship managers, but radically empowers them.\\\\nJeffrey’s perspective is pragmatic. “I don’t believe personal relationships can be displaced,” he says. “What we feel is that a relationship manager and technology should coexist. Technology actually helps complement and enable us to deliver an exceptional level of service.”\\\\nHe describes a powerful synergy where AI and data analytics handle the tedious work. “Why spend a few hours trying to prepare a presentation to a customer when technology can actually help you put it together?” he asks.\\\\nInstead, AI modules help relationship managers size up a customer’s profile and generate proposed portfolios that fit their risk criteria.\\\\nRHB now uses AI-driven tools to prepare customer profiles, run simulations and generate recommended portfolios — work that used to take hours.\\\\nHowever, Jeffrey was clear that this is “just merely triggers”. The final, crucial value is delivered by the human in the loop. “It’s then left to the relationship managers to actually … spend more time engaging with the customer, giving context and insights, who listens, who explains trade-offs, and having a more thorough decision on it.”\\\\nBy reducing administrative load, RHB frees its relationship managers to spend more time on conversations that actually matter: explaining the nuances of a structured product, guiding a client through the implications of a new tax policy on their overseas rental unit, rolling out a multi-currency plan for a child’s schooling, or providing reassurance during market volatility.\\\\nTechnology provides the data, but the relationship managers provide the wisdom, context and trust. It is a hybrid approach that acknowledges both the power of data and the irreplaceability of human judgement.\\\\nWhen asked what comes next, Jeffrey doesn’t hesitate. “We’re preparing for the generational wealth transfer.”\\\\nHe highlighted the imminent large generational wealth transfer as a critical window, noting that RHB is developing frameworks for family office services to help support this shift, from succession planning to multi-generational advisory.\\\\n“Islamic wealth management is another frontier, one that we see growing rapidly. It’s about purposeful distribution, purification and aligning wealth with values,” he says.\\\\nFor RHB, the foray into solutions like ringgit-denominated overseas property financing is more than a product launch. It is a symbol of a broader ambition.\\\\nIn a world of increasing interconnectedness, the bank is positioning itself not just as a manager of capital, but as a strategic partner that builds bridges — across borders and asset classes, and between cutting-edge technology and timeless human insight.\\\\nThrough personalisation, RHB is building a new architecture for wealth, designed to stand the test of time and global uncertainty.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd offers a specialised financial solution for Malaysian residents and premier customers looking to purchase residential property in key international markets: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan. This product is designed to simplify cross-border investment by mitigating major risks and providing flexible terms.\\\\nEligible properties must be residential, over 50 sq m and be freehold or leasehold with at least 70 years remaining on the lease.\\\\nA cornerstone of this offering is its ringgit-denominated structure. By taking the loan and making repayments in ringgit, borrowers are safeguarded from the volatility of foreign exchange rates, providing certainty in their long-term financial planning.\\\\nKey financial terms include:\\\\nHigh financing margin:Investors can secure up to 85% financing for UK properties and 75% for Australian properties, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nSubstantial loan amounts: The loan amounts are significant, with minimums from RM500,000 in Australia and RM800,000 in the UK.\\\\nLong tenure:A lengthy loan tenure of up to 30 years, or until the borrower reaches age 70, provides manageable repayment schedules.The product also features valuable flexibility. The “Full Flexi” option allows for prepayments and the ability to redraw excess funds, leading to interest savings.Furthermore, an early release option is available during a property’s construction phase, allowing clients to lock in favourable foreign exchange rates ahead of the property’s completion.This comprehensive package positions RHB’s loan as a strategic tool for Malaysians to confidently expand their real estate portfolios into stable, high-demand international markets while managing currency and financing complexities.\\\\nRHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan\\\\nScan / Click\\\\nBecoming an RHB Premier customer and unlocking a world of privileged banking services is designed to be easy and accessible.

Prior to that, it traded in the mid-1,800 range in 2018 and had climbed to its historic peak of 1,883.90 in July 2014\\\\nThe prolonged retreat since then, driven by a mix of domestic and external headwinds and the pandemic-driven cycle, means that any return to the 1,700 zone would be viewed as a sign of a market regaining lost ground after more than half a decade.\\\\nHEAVYWEIGHTS HOLD THE KEY\\\\nMaybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) said the local bourse could grind closer to the psychologically important 1,700 level by year-end if heavyweight banks and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) finally play catch-up after a year of underperformance.\\\\nThe research house is keeping its year-end 2025 target for the benchmark index at 1,660, representing about three per cent upside from current levels, but said a move toward 1,700 is \"possible\" if several large caps rerate together.\\\\n\"At this stage, we think 1,700 remains attainable provided there is positive price movement in the banks, TNB, Gamuda Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd and Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd,\" it said.\\\\nThe target is anchored on a 15 times price-earnings valuation of projected 2026 earnings.\\\\nMaybank IB said the FBM KLCI has been trading in a narrow band of 1,610 to 1,630 in recent weeks, even as nearly 40 per cent of its component stocks have delivered share price gains this year.\\\\nThe main drag has come from the banking sector and TNB, which together account for about 30 per cent of the index\\\\\\'s weight.\\\\n\"Every five per cent increase in the top three banks\\\\\\' share price collectively could lift the index by 25 points,\" it said, adding that a recovery in TNB, which is facing persistent concern over the financial impact of tax issues, would further support the index.\\\\nA SEASONALLY STRONG FINISH\\\\nMalacca Securities Bhd research head Loui Low said the FBM KLCI has shown a tendency to close the year higher, with more than 85 per cent of December readings over the past two decades ending in positive territory and averaging gains of about 1.8 per cent.\\\\nHe said December is often viewed as a \"seasonally favourable period\" due to year-end window-dressing activities.\\\\n\"Considering these historical statistics and the FBM KLCI\\\\\\'s current market positioning, there is a reasonable expectation for a further upward movement of 30 to 40 points,\" he told Business Times.\\\\nA rally toward 1,700, however, would require an index gain of at least 100 points or more than five per cent from current levels.\\\\nConsequently, the more realistic target range for the index is projected to be between 1,650 and 1,660.\\\\n\"Ultimately, this trajectory will need the help from the banking sector and other index heavyweights as they approach the end of the year,\" said Low.\\\\nHe added that banks remain well-positioned to benefit from window dressing and could stage a notable rebound.

Interest expense slipped 0.7% in the quarter, while it recorded higher income from Islamic banking and sale of derivative financial instruments.

Net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (3QFY2025) fell to RM28.21 million from RM86.88 million a year earlier, due to lower energy payments following a steam turbine pipe leakage at the Tanjung Bin Energy plant.

I understand their focus on historical risk-adjusted returns, particularly the Sharpe ratio. However, I continue to disagree with their overall assessment. While historical performance provides valuable context, my fundamental analysis suggests that the underlying business fundamentals warrant caution, and I believe the Valuation agent is still underestimating these risks. The fact that they are running a shorter-term analysis suggests they are also acknowledging some increased uncertainty, which reinforces my concerns.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My fundamental analysis adds a crucial layer of scrutiny by examining the underlying business drivers and sustainability of performance. Specifically, my RAG analysis has consistently highlighted concerns regarding gross margin and potential credit risks. These are not merely backward-looking metrics but indicators of potential future challenges. While the Sharpe ratio reflects past performance, it doesn't necessarily guarantee future success, especially if the underlying business fundamentals are weakening. I believe the Valuation agent's reliance on historical data may not fully capture the evolving risk profile of RHB Bank.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: Considering all perspectives and my previous analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation with 70% confidence. The Valuation agent's reduced confidence in their BUY recommendation further validates my concerns. While the historical risk-adjusted returns are a positive factor, the fundamental risks I've identified, particularly regarding gross margin and asset quality, remain significant enough to warrant a cautious approach. For a moderate investor seeking a balance between growth and stability, a HOLD recommendation is still the most appropriate, in my opinion.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

While the Fundamental agent focuses on inherent business risks, sentiment reflects how these risks are being interpreted by the broader market. The fact that sentiment hasn't turned decisively negative despite the identified fundamental concerns suggests that the market isn't panicking, but it also isn't overly optimistic.

\\'TheEdge\\', \\'body\\': \"This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 22, 2025 - December 28, 2025\\\\nMALAYSIA’S stock market performance has been relatively flat this year, lagging behind the strong rallies seen in regional peers such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia, whose indices have surged to record highs.\\\\nThe benchmark FBM KLCI is up only marginally year to date (YTD), weighed down by market uncertainty stemming from US tariffs and lacklustre corporate earnings. The broader Emas Index, which tracks Main Market stocks, is down 4% over the same period, while the ACE Index has fallen 11.3%.\\\\nThe FBM KLCI has been largely supported by heavyweight banking stocks, with the Financial Services Index remaining stable throughout the year. RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) led the pack with a YTD gain of 23.3%, followed by AMMB Holdings Bhd (KL:AMBANK) (+20.1%), Malayan Banking Bhd (KL:MAYBANK) (+6.9%) and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) (+5.3%).\\\\nDecember is typically a month of gains for equities, buoyed by portfolio managers’ efforts to enhance year-end performance through window dressing. The FBM KLCI has gained 2.3% so far this month.\\\\nNg Zhu Hann, CEO of Tradeview Capital Sdn Bhd, observes that the market sentiment this year has leaned more towards profit-taking, amid the net foreign fund outflow of about RM21 billion YTD \\\\xad— the largest since the net outflow of RM24.6 billion in 2020 — against net buying of RM20.3 billion by institutional funds.\\\\n“That is a very alarming level. While one could argue that some equity outflows have moved into the bond market, it does not send a very healthy signal to the equity market, and that is my biggest concern,” he tells The Edge.\\\\nHe says local institutional funds have played their part in supporting the market, but their capacity is limited, while retail participation continues to decline.\\\\n“As for local funds, they have done what they can to provide support, but there is only so much they can do. Retail participation also keeps coming down,” he adds.\\\\nForeign investors have remained net sellers of Malaysian equities in the final quarter of this year, with net outflows of RM4.32 billion as at Dec 12, compared with RM4.3 billion in 3Q, according to MBSB Research. In 1Q and 2Q, foreign investors net sold RM9.96 billion and RM2.16 billion worth of equities respectively. In 2024, net foreign selling amounted to RM4.21 billion.\\\\nOn the prospects of a reversal in foreign fund flows in 2026, Ng says this will largely depend on the US interest rate trajectory, particularly whether cuts exceed current expectations of at least three reductions, which could bring the key policy rate closer to 2.5%. The US federal funds rate is currently in the range of 3.5% to 3.75% after three cuts this year.\\\\n“If rate cuts are in line with expectations, I don’t see a significant influx of foreign funds into our equity market in the near term, because if they were going to come in, they would have already done so,” he says.\\\\nHe notes that the strengthening ringgit also reduces the appeal to foreign investors, unless there is a strategic shift from bonds to equities.\\\\n“It comes down to the rate differentials as fund managers seek the highest possible returns with the lowest risk. For now, the US bond market remains attractive, at least until further rate cuts materialise,” he adds.\\\\nAmong the top-performing large-cap stocks YTD are 99 Speed Mart Retail Holdings Bhd (KL:99SMART) (+45.4%), United Plantations Bhd (KL:UTDPLT) (+45.2%), Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd (KL:PMETAL) (+42.2%), Malayan Cement Bhd (KL:MCEMENT) and Sunway Construction Group Bhd (KL:SUNCON) (32.1%).\\\\n99 Speed Mart’s strong share price performance has been underpinned by its solid earnings, which hit a record high of RM160.65 million in the July-to-September quarter on the back of higher sales and store counts. Press Metal is on track to post record earnings in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2026 (FY2026), driven by elevated aluminium prices and easing alumina costs, after posting a 15% rise in 9MFY2025 net profit to RM1.51 billion, according to Hong Leong Investment Bank Research’s Dec 15 note.\\\\nAmid broader market uncertainty, real estate investment trusts (REITs) have emerged as the best-performing sector on Bursa Malaysia, with IGB REIT (KL:IGBREIT) and Sunway REIT (KL:SUNREIT) chalking up YTD gains of 30.2% and 27.8% respectively. Notably, the Bursa Malaysia REIT Index is up more than 7% over the same period.\\\\nOn the flip side, selling pressure has weighed on several stocks, including PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM) (-31.9%), IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) (-25.9%), YTL Power International Bhd (KL:YTLPOWR) (-24%), YTL Corp Bhd (KL:YTL) (-19.5%) and Genting Bhd (KL:GENTING) (-19.5%).\\\\nPETRONAS Chemicals has continued to suffer from margin compression due to ongoing oversupply and weak demand, while IJM’s financials have been dragged down by lower contribution from property development and port operations. YTL and its majority-owned utility arm YTL Power began their new financial year (FY2026) with moderate earnings growth as lower operating expenses and finance costs offset a dip in revenue.\\\\nMalacca Securities head of research Loui Low notes that the local bourse has performed reasonably well since the start of the month, in line with historical trends that show the benchmark index typically ends December in positive territory.\\\\n“The current FBM KLCI level is within our expectations. We hope it can close at 1,660 points by year end,” he says.\\\\nLooking ahead to 2026, Low believes investors will need to wait for more catalysts before trading activity picks up meaningfully.\\\\n“Third-quarter corporate results were quite neutral and failed to capture much investor attention. Furthermore, several sectors may be affected by the strong ringgit. So I think for now, trading is rather scattered,” he says.\\\\nLow sees opportunities in selected technology stocks such as UWC Bhd (KL:UWC), Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) and ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), all of which recently delivered stronger financial results.\\\\nHe advises investors to position for the consumer sector to benefit from Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026).\\\\n“Some consumer stocks could be suitable for long-term strategies. We need to see whether earnings can be sustained going into the first quarter of 2026. With the ringgit’s current strength, input costs should be lower for the next couple of months, which would support earnings,” he says.\\\\nLow also prefers companies linked to smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption, including public space networked systems provider ITMAX System Bhd (KL:ITMAX) and intelligent asset management and water technology solutions provider Insights Analytics Bhd (KL:IAB).\\\\nTA Securities also expects the FBM KLCI to end the year at 1,660 points, with upward momentum extending into 2026. “Greater clarity on US trade policy, ample liquidity from ongoing monetary easing, and renewed foreign inflows are set to bolster investor confidence and drive further gains in the index next year,” the research house says in a Dec 17 note.\\\\nTA Securities highlights that Malaysia’s low foreign shareholding presents upside optionality for substantial inflows when global risk appetite recovers. Foreign shareholding of Malaysian equities stood at 19% in November, not far from the 2003 trough of 18.1%.\\\\nThe research house’s key investment themes for 2026 are energy transition, digital economy and infrastructure, robust consumption and tourism, fundamentally solid blue-chip stocks, as well as small- and mid-cap growth stocks.\\\\nApex Securities head of research Ong Tze Hern identifies three key themes for the local equity market in 2026, namely tourism, affordable consumption and renewable energy.\\\\n“As VM2026 kicks off, this will benefit the aviation, hospitality and REIT sectors,” he says, noting that more than RM700 million has been set aside for tourism under Budget 2026, including RM500 million specifically for VM2026, as well as a tax relief of RM1,000 on individual income tax for entrance fees to local tourism attractions and cultural programmes.\\\\nOng says selected consumer players are expected to benefit from various government initiatives aimed at supporting the low-income group. Nearly RM20 billion has been allocated to assistance programmes this year, including the Rahmah Cash Contribution (STR), the Rahmah Basic Contribution (Sara) and aid from the Social Welfare Department (JKM).\\\\nIn renewable energy, he favours companies involved in ground-mounted solar panels, as rooftop solar players will need to comply with mandatory battery requirements for self-consumption users from January 2026 onwards, which means higher investment outlay is required.\\\\nOverall, Ong believes stronger catalysts — including more robust economic growth — are needed for the FBM KLCI to breach the 1,700-point level.\\\\n“I don’t think window dressing alone will push the FBM KLCI above 1,700 points. At best, it may close near that level,” he says.\\\\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong expects selected construction and data centre-linked stocks to outperform in 2026, supported by a healthy job pipeline. He also highlights tourism-related plays that could benefit companies such as Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (KL:F&AMP;N), Nestlé (Malaysia) Bhd (KL:NESTLE) and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (KL:CARLSBG).\\\\nMeanwhile, Tradeview’s Ng is positive on the renewable energy, utility, financial and healthcare sectors, but is cautious about the REIT outlook for 2026 as the withholding tax concession on REIT distributions is set to expire on Dec 31 this year, with no announcement on an extension so far. “If REIT income becomes taxable, that would impact the returns to unitholders,” he points out.\\\\nHe adds that the local equity market will need to rely more heavily on the domestic economy, rather than global conditions.\\\\n“We need to be able to sustain domestic consumption and investment, instead of relying on global macro events to shape our prospects. This means the government needs to look into supporting small and medium enterprises to keep them competitive,” he elaborates.\\\\nSave bysubscribingto us for \\\\n      your print and/or \\\\n      digital copy.\\\\nP/S: The Edge is also available onApple\\'s App StoreandAndroid\\'s Google Play.\"}, {\\'headline\\': \\'FBM KLCI breaks winning streak on profit-taking\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 26, 17, 26), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: The FBM KLCI snapped its winning streak on profit-taking, ending the session slightly lower as selling pressure weighed on the broader market.\\\\nThe 30-stock closed 1.21 points, or 0.07%, lower at 1,677.10 after trading between an intraday high of 1,678.29 and a low of 1,670.83.

Moreover, most banks still maintain fairly sizeable management overlays to buffer against any further deterioration in asset quality.\\\\nCorrespondingly, we forecast aggregate return on average equity (ROAE) to average 10.3% in 2026E and 2027E respectively, up from 10.2% in 2025E.\\\\nDividend yields are decent, averaging about 5.5% for FY25E and 5.8% for FY26E. We project dividend yields of more than 5% for most banks this financial year, except for Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (KL:HLBANK) at about four-plus per cent. Meanwhile, valuations are still undemanding, in our view, with most banks trading close to -1 standard deviation to their forward PERs’ historical mean.\\\\nWe expect an improved operating environment for CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s (KL:CIMB) operations amid lower net interest margin pressure in Singapore and a stable economic outlook in Malaysia and Indonesia. AMMB Holdings Bhd’s (KL:AMBANK) focus on proactive funding cost management and business banking operations should contribute to growth momentum, as it strives for higher dividend payouts. We expect improved earnings momentum in the second half of FY26 for Alliance Bank on lower credit costs, and project a three-year net profit CAGR of 7% on robust loan growth and more stable margins.\\\\nHaving recently upgraded our calls on several stocks, we now have “buy” calls on Alliance Bank, AmBank, CIMB, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (KL:HLFG), Public Bank Bhd (KL:PBBANK) and RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK).

Hence, we are maintaining our FY25-26F forecasts, target price of RM3 and “outperform” rating.\\\\nOur earlier estimated funding gap for the project was US$2 billion (RM8.3 billion) to US$3 billion. However, following the exit of MGM Resorts from the bid, stronger earnings and cash flows from being New York City’s only full-service casino until around 2030, the gap should narrow to about US$1 billion to US$2 billion, or smaller. As such, the initial fear of substantial dilution is lowered. In any case, GENM owns 15 acres of Miami land and 270 million treasury shares worth US$100 million to US$200 million, depending on the selling price. GENM can also issue up to 10% of new shares without triggering a rights issue to raise another US$300 million to US$400 million.\\\\nSeparately, Genting Bhd’s (KL:GENTING) shareholding in GENM has risen to 73% after the closure of its mandatory general offer yesterday (Dec 1).

Management at the briefing pointed to quarterly losses for its dairy farm business peaking by about 2QFY9/26F.\\\\nThird, we see F&N’s cumulative free cash flow of RM1.6 billion between FY26 and FY28 providing room for higher dividend payout ratios beginning FY27F.\\\\nWe raise our core net profit estimate for F&N by 2.6% in FY28F to reflect a lower tax rate as the dairy farm business begins to generate profits, allowing for tax losses and incentives for its dairy venture to be utilised.

Major institutions are deploying multimillion-ringgit AI systems for fraud detection and customer analytics, to automate processes and to enhance branch services.\\\\nBank Negara Malaysia’s “Artificial Intelligence in the Malaysian Financial Sector” discussion paper, released on Aug 5, reports that 71% of local banks now operate at least one AI application, up from 56% a year earlier. This signals an industry shift from the pilot phase to production.\\\\n“Looking ahead, more than 60% of banking institutions and insurers and takaful operators view AI as a strategic priority at their institutions in the next one to three years,” the central bank notes.\\\\nIt attributes the growth in AI applications to the increased interest in exploring generative AI (Gen AI) applications, such as ChatGPT. There has also been growing interest in agentic AI, which refers to AI systems capable of taking autonomous actions to achieve a goal, such as an AI that automatically freezes a suspicious transaction upon detecting fraud risk.\\\\nPwC Malaysia financial services consulting partner Neha Mani tells The Edge that AI is now a significant priority for most Malaysian financial institutions, which is reflected in the “leadership time, organisational resources and investment” dedicated to its development.\\\\n“Investments are being made to ready the banks to leverage AI solutions at scale, such as investments towards cloud infrastructure and building a data infrastructure. Some leading financial institutions have even set up SWAT teams within their environment to help them identify and deploy use cases,” says Neha.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK), for instance, reported in its 2024 integrated report that it invested RM868.7 million in digital transformation and IT infrastructure between 2020 and 2024, with the digital transaction rate reaching 92.2% last year across a user base of over 2.9 million.\\\\nNeha says the biggest difference between local FIs and their foreign counterparts is the scale of their AI deployment. “US banks, for example, have already scaled AI-based tools in areas such as risk and fraud. Overall, organisational and leadership readiness is at different maturity levels across markets,” she adds.\\\\nLeading banks in AI transformation are adopting a strategic, large-scale and business-driven approach with “comprehensive changes instead of isolated initiatives” that distinguishes them from institutions still in the pilot phase, she says.\\\\nAs an example, she cites a global card issuer that uses AI and machine learning for real-time credit card fraud detection, and a major American retail bank that utilises an AI or machine-learning-driven virtual assistant to provide personalised financial insights and assistance with tasks like bill payments and budgeting.\\\\nWhile digital banks are “AI-native by design”, some traditional institutions are matching their pace. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC) is an example. It was the first bank in Singapore to establish an AI unit in 2018 to build in-house capabilities. That has since evolved into the bank’s group data office, where AI is a core strategic lever for productivity, revenue growth and risk reduction.\\\\nAccording to OCBC’s 2024 annual report and an interview with its head of group data office Donald MacDonald, AI now drives about six million decisions daily across the bank, from personalised credit card offers to fraud detection. Its early start has accelerated the use of Gen AI over the past two years.\\\\nIn November 2023, OCBC said it became the first Singapore bank to launch a Gen AI chatbot, known as “OCBC GPT”, to support 30,000 employees in writing, research and ideation. This came after earlier deployments of internally built Gen AI tools for coding, document summarisation, call transcription and querying internal knowledge bases that have boosted productivity by up to 50%.\\\\nAs OCBC continues deepening its AI and Gen AI capabilities, it is strengthening governance to ensure adherence to FEAT (fair, ethical, accountable, transparent) principles, with all AI models undergoing regular accuracy reviews and rigorous testing to prevent bias.\\\\n“I work very closely with all the different unit heads to [use] the data to make better decisions. Increasingly, it’s about how we can use the data, especially AI, to transform the processes to make [the work] more efficient,” says MacDonald.\\\\nHis team of about 150 people, comprising data engineers, analysts and scientists, is responsible for data literacy alongside managing the bank’s data science platform and strategy.\\\\n“AI is applied across all aspects of OCBC’s business, namely in revenue generation, customer investment decisions, cost reduction and productivity improvement, as well as risk reduction. In the third area, we apply AI to reduce risk in areas like credit scoring as well as fraud and scam detection, anti-money laundering and things like that. These are key focuses at OCBC.\\\\n“We measure the value of all of our use cases which, going by the [collective] value of our use cases, AI generates [a significant amount] in quantifiable benefits every year,” says MacDonald, adding such AI-driven gains that are measured as “quantifiable benefits” run into the hundreds of millions of Singapore dollars each year.\\\\nOCBC’s strategy focus is agentic AI, which can automate complex, end-to-end workflow and reasoning models for strategic decision-making.\\\\n“Agentic AI is the thing that’s going to unlock complex workflow. So, if you’re in our financial crime space and you need to investigate a suspicious transaction and write a report about it, an agent could do that for you. If you were in a command centre and someone asked for a fee waiver, the agent could evaluate that and provide the rationale,” MacDonald explains.\\\\n“Then there is OCBC’s strategic decision-making, like how OCBC should be positioning its balance sheet or where OCBC should be investing its money amid all that’s been going on with the US Federal Reserve. So, rather than having just humans thinking about what we should do, we’re also looking at using reasoning models to handle some of these strategic decisions.”\\\\nHe also sees AI transforming customer interaction with banks.\\\\n“As Gen AI understands natural language, it is able to have a reasonably smart conversation with you now. You could ask, ‘OCBC, what happened in the market last night and what should I do?’ Because the agent knows your profile, the equities you like and your risk appetite, it would give you a recommendation,” MacDonald says.\\\\nFor institutions that are digital-first, such as newly licensed digital banks, AI is embedded from the start.\\\\nFoong Chee Mun, chief product officer of the YTL-Sea Digital Bank Project — one of five entities awarded a digital banking licence in Malaysia — notes this difference at Ryt Bank, which was launched by YTL Group and Sea Ltd as the world’s first AI-powered bank.\\\\n“At Ryt Bank, AI isn’t a layer we added later, it’s the foundation. Every operational flow, from onboarding to risk and customer service, was designed assuming a machine partner is always in the loop. Our core systems speak natural language, not just code or APIs (application programming interfaces).\\\\nThat allows customers to perform transactions conversationally, and it allows our internal systems such as credit, fraud and compliance to constantly learn and adapt in real time,” says Foong, who is also CEO of YTL AI Labs.\\\\nDigital banks rely more on automation and data science teams than on conventional branch or operations staff. Ryt Bank was designed “around intelligence itself as the new infrastructure”, meaning its teams are structured differently from those of a traditional bank.\\\\n“What’s exciting for us is that we got to reimagine how banking could be built from the ground up in this generative AI era. We weren’t constrained by legacy structures or branches. That means our teams look quite different from a traditional bank,” Foong acknowledges.\\\\nOver half of Ryt Bank’s workforce comprises engineers, AI experts and data scientists, with safety being the core of its processes.\\\\n“For us, safety isn’t a compliance checklist; it’s part of how we engineer. Every product, every model and every decision system is designed with that mindset from day one. In short, we’re structured less like a traditional bank and more like a technology company: intelligent, data-driven and safe by design,” Foong says.\\\\nThe path to AI adoption is not without its hurdles. PwC Malaysia’s partner for digital, cloud and data Norliza Mazni Nawi points out a fundamental issue: data quality.\\\\n“AI models are only as effective as the data on which they are built. Without rich, accurate data, their potential is limited, stunting banks’ ability to make smart decisions and provide valuable insights. While we are seeing local banks experimenting with AI use cases and offering personalised services to customers, poor data quality remains one of the top challenges contributing to AI project failures,” Norliza says.\\\\nFrom a digital banking perspective, Foong highlights the complexity of conversational AI, where operators must understand intent, tone and context across diverse linguistic backgrounds, rather than merely predicting numbers.\\\\n“The hardest part is that language is messy. People don’t always speak in neat, structured sentences, often mixing English, Malay, Mandarin, even slang, all in the same message. So, one of the biggest challenges is getting the model to truly understand what users mean, not just what they say. That’s why we spend a lot of time fine-tuning for the Malaysian context, culture and code-switching patterns,” Foong shares.\\\\nSafety and reliability are critical, as any misunderstanding instantly affects trust.\\\\n“You can’t afford a wrong tone or a misleading response, especially in banking. So, we’ve built strong human-in-the-loop systems, content filters and fallback mechanisms to make sure the AI stays accurate and aligned with our values,” he says.\\\\nPwC’s Neha observes that AI offers banks quick and tangible returns on investment or ROI, not just through real-time fraud management (which reduces financial losses and operational risks) but also the automation of repetitive tasks — such as compliance checks, data entry and report generation — that lowers labour costs, accelerates processing times and minimises errors.\\\\n“Institutions that embrace Gen AI early are likely to experience improvements in operational efficiencies and cost reductions, while also managing risks more effectively with the help of predictive analytics. These early adopters will not only be ahead in terms of technological development but also set new benchmarks for customer engagement and operational excellence,” Norliza adds.\\\\n\\\\nSave bysubscribingto us for \\\\n      your print and/or \\\\n      digital copy.\\\\nP/S: The Edge is also available onApple\\'s App StoreandAndroid\\'s Google Play.\"}, {\\'headline\\': \\'Banks expected to enter 2026 on firmer ground\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 10, 0, 0), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'CIMB Research has upgraded the banking sector to “overweight” from “neutral”.\\\\nPETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s banking sector looks set to enter 2026 on firmer footing, as analysts point to easing margin pressure, steadier funding conditions and healthier capital trajectories despite a year marked by policy-rate adjustments and intense deposit competition.\\\\nCIMB Research, for one, has upgraded the banking sector to “overweight” from “neutral” in its recent strategy note, citing its “buy” re-ratings forMalayan Banking Bhd(Maybank) andAMMB Holdings Bhd, alongside its “buy” calls forPublic Bank Bhd,RHB BankBhd andHong Leong Bank Bhd.\\\\nThe brokerage highlighted that although the sector’s core net profit growth is expected to remain subdued at 0.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) for 2025 and 4.3% y-o-y for 2026, the investment thesis for Malaysian banks has shifted from cyclical earnings growth to a phase of “capital-efficient growth” driven by risk-weighted assets (RWA) optimisation....Full Article on TheStar\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\nFull Article on TheStar\\'}, {\\'headline\\': \\'Bargain hunting lifts FBM KLCI after four-day losing streak\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 9, 17, 23), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: Bargain hunters returned to the market, nudging the FBM KLCI higher and breaking its four-day slide.\\\\nThe FBM KLCI rebounded 1.39 points, or 0.09%, to 1,614.17, snapping a four-day selling streak.

The bank is aiming for double-digit fee income growth and plans to double its investment and bancassurance assets under management (AUM) within three years.\\\\nOne of the key drivers of this growth, Jeffrey reveals, is the synergistic flow between RHB’s strong SME and commercial banking base, as well as its premier wealth management.\\\\n“We have built a strong SME, commercial and corporate client base, and many of these relationships organically flow into our retail wealth management business,” he explains.\\\\n“Behind many of the [corporates and SMEs] is a founder, a director and a family, who are also high-net-worth individuals in their own right, and their personal wealth decisions are closely intertwined with their business life,” he adds.\\\\nJeffrey says this natural overlap gives RHB a unique vantage point. “When you understand a client’s business cycle — their cash flow rhythms, expansion plans, risk appetite — you understand them. That enables us to architect their personal wealth strategy with far greater precision. Their corporate journey informs their personal portfolio, and vice versa.”\\\\nThis, he says, is what makes RHB’s integrated model powerful. “It allows us to help clients translate the success they’ve created in their business into a well-structured, global personal wealth plan.”\\\\nOne of the most tangible examples of this philosophy is the bank’s cross-border mortgage solution: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan.\\\\nJeffrey identifies the UK and Australia as the primary markets, driven by education, familiarity and a search for diversified returns.\\\\n“Many parents studied in these countries, and now their children are going there too,” he notes. “Which is precisely why they are turning their attention to diversifying their portfolios and securing exposure that extends beyond the onshore market.”\\\\nThe property loan specifically targets prime residential properties in Zones 1 to 3 of London and within 30km of Sydney or Melbourne’s central business district (CBD).\\\\n“One of the key considerations is currency exposure,” he explains. “For instance, financing in pound sterling, you’re subject not only to exchange rate fluctuations, but also varying interest-rate regimes.”\\\\nThe appeal, however, lies in the structure of the product. RHB’s overseas property financing is both denominated and disbursed in the ringgit, providing a safeguard against currency volatility. “This effectively eliminates future forex fluctuations,” Jeffrey explains.\\\\nThis ringgit-denominated shield, combined with high financing margins and flexible features, repositions an international property acquisition from an unpredictable venture into a strategic, calculable asset. It is a surprisingly straightforward idea — and its simplicity is its strength.\\\\nThe offering is designed for flexibility and accessibility. For eligible Malaysian residents and premier customers, the bank offers a high margin of financing — up to 85% for UK properties and 75% for Australian ones, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nThe loan tenure can extend up to 30 years or until the borrower turns 70, with a flexible “redraw” feature that allows clients to prepay and access excess funds, providing both interest savings and financial agility.\\\\nFurthermore, an early release option allows clients to lock in favourable exchange rates during the construction phase, adding another layer of strategic financial management.\\\\nClients appreciate the loan’s flexi features: higher financing margins, redraw capabilities for liquidity and an early release option that lets them lock in favourable FX rates during construction.\\\\n“It’s about giving control back to the customer,” says Jeffrey. “When you’re thousands of miles away, certainty matters.”\\\\nOne topic Jeffrey approaches cautiously and refreshingly is digital assets.\\\\nA commitment to consistency does not mean shying away from innovation. In fact, Jeffrey is a strong advocate for continuously educating clients on alternative and innovative asset classes to ensure their portfolios are future-proof.\\\\n“We cannot ignore digital assets,” he says matter-of-factly, revealing that RHB has already launched unitised funds invested in Bitcoin ETFs. “But it must be done responsibly.\\\\n“We launched that early this year and we’ve got some good traction … it’s for a selected segment of customers. Not everyone will be suitable for it due to its volatility, but I think that is also another example of us coming up with alternative innovative asset classes for their consideration.”\\\\nBeyond cryptocurrency, he pointed to the growing demand for structured products — specialised, non-unitised offerings based on equities, commodities or credits. These products can be engineered to offer principal protection for the prudent or leveraged upside for those seeking higher returns, all carefully matched to a client’s risk profile.\\\\nThis educational journey also extends to the foundational pillar of wealth preservation.\\\\nBut Jeffrey repeatedly circles back to the fundamentals. “You can’t run away from protection,” he asserts. “A single unexpected event or personal uncertainty can set back decades of wealth building.”\\\\nThrough insurance and legacy planning, the bank helps clients build a defensive bulwark around their assets, ensuring that accumulated wealth is preserved and transferred efficiently to the next generation.\\\\nThis groundedness, acknowledging innovation without losing sight of risk is what affluent Malaysian investors quietly look for but rarely hear articulated so clearly.\\\\nUnderpinning all of RHB’s wealth management strategies is a disciplined investment philosophy that prioritises long-term, steady growth over chasing short-term windfalls.\\\\n“I think the main theme that we usually advocate is that wealth management is about consistent returns rather than one-off,” Jeffrey emphasises. “So consistent returns would mean there’s obviously going to be diversification.\\\\n“So this is where we come in and we propose what we deem is a model portfolio for our customers that fits their risk and their life stage. I think that’s very important.”\\\\nThis client-centric model means a 30-year-old entrepreneur will have a radically different portfolio from a 60-year-old preparing for retirement. The common thread is not the assets themselves, but the goal of predictable, risk-adjusted growth tailored to individual circumstances.\\\\nIn an industry racing to automate, RHB is making a significant bet on a different future: one where cutting-edge technology does not replace the relationship managers, but radically empowers them.\\\\nJeffrey’s perspective is pragmatic. “I don’t believe personal relationships can be displaced,” he says. “What we feel is that a relationship manager and technology should coexist. Technology actually helps complement and enable us to deliver an exceptional level of service.”\\\\nHe describes a powerful synergy where AI and data analytics handle the tedious work. “Why spend a few hours trying to prepare a presentation to a customer when technology can actually help you put it together?” he asks.\\\\nInstead, AI modules help relationship managers size up a customer’s profile and generate proposed portfolios that fit their risk criteria.\\\\nRHB now uses AI-driven tools to prepare customer profiles, run simulations and generate recommended portfolios — work that used to take hours.\\\\nHowever, Jeffrey was clear that this is “just merely triggers”. The final, crucial value is delivered by the human in the loop. “It’s then left to the relationship managers to actually … spend more time engaging with the customer, giving context and insights, who listens, who explains trade-offs, and having a more thorough decision on it.”\\\\nBy reducing administrative load, RHB frees its relationship managers to spend more time on conversations that actually matter: explaining the nuances of a structured product, guiding a client through the implications of a new tax policy on their overseas rental unit, rolling out a multi-currency plan for a child’s schooling, or providing reassurance during market volatility.\\\\nTechnology provides the data, but the relationship managers provide the wisdom, context and trust. It is a hybrid approach that acknowledges both the power of data and the irreplaceability of human judgement.\\\\nWhen asked what comes next, Jeffrey doesn’t hesitate. “We’re preparing for the generational wealth transfer.”\\\\nHe highlighted the imminent large generational wealth transfer as a critical window, noting that RHB is developing frameworks for family office services to help support this shift, from succession planning to multi-generational advisory.\\\\n“Islamic wealth management is another frontier, one that we see growing rapidly. It’s about purposeful distribution, purification and aligning wealth with values,” he says.\\\\nFor RHB, the foray into solutions like ringgit-denominated overseas property financing is more than a product launch. It is a symbol of a broader ambition.\\\\nIn a world of increasing interconnectedness, the bank is positioning itself not just as a manager of capital, but as a strategic partner that builds bridges — across borders and asset classes, and between cutting-edge technology and timeless human insight.\\\\nThrough personalisation, RHB is building a new architecture for wealth, designed to stand the test of time and global uncertainty.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd offers a specialised financial solution for Malaysian residents and premier customers looking to purchase residential property in key international markets: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan. This product is designed to simplify cross-border investment by mitigating major risks and providing flexible terms.\\\\nEligible properties must be residential, over 50 sq m and be freehold or leasehold with at least 70 years remaining on the lease.\\\\nA cornerstone of this offering is its ringgit-denominated structure. By taking the loan and making repayments in ringgit, borrowers are safeguarded from the volatility of foreign exchange rates, providing certainty in their long-term financial planning.\\\\nKey financial terms include:\\\\nHigh financing margin:Investors can secure up to 85% financing for UK properties and 75% for Australian properties, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nSubstantial loan amounts: The loan amounts are significant, with minimums from RM500,000 in Australia and RM800,000 in the UK.\\\\nLong tenure:A lengthy loan tenure of up to 30 years, or until the borrower reaches age 70, provides manageable repayment schedules.The product also features valuable flexibility.

Prior to that, it traded in the mid-1,800 range in 2018 and had climbed to its historic peak of 1,883.90 in July 2014\\\\nThe prolonged retreat since then, driven by a mix of domestic and external headwinds and the pandemic-driven cycle, means that any return to the 1,700 zone would be viewed as a sign of a market regaining lost ground after more than half a decade.\\\\nHEAVYWEIGHTS HOLD THE KEY\\\\nMaybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) said the local bourse could grind closer to the psychologically important 1,700 level by year-end if heavyweight banks and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) finally play catch-up after a year of underperformance.\\\\nThe research house is keeping its year-end 2025 target for the benchmark index at 1,660, representing about three per cent upside from current levels, but said a move toward 1,700 is \"possible\" if several large caps rerate together.\\\\n\"At this stage, we think 1,700 remains attainable provided there is positive price movement in the banks, TNB, Gamuda Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd and Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd,\" it said.\\\\nThe target is anchored on a 15 times price-earnings valuation of projected 2026 earnings.\\\\nMaybank IB said the FBM KLCI has been trading in a narrow band of 1,610 to 1,630 in recent weeks, even as nearly 40 per cent of its component stocks have delivered share price gains this year.\\\\nThe main drag has come from the banking sector and TNB, which together account for about 30 per cent of the index\\\\\\'s weight.\\\\n\"Every five per cent increase in the top three banks\\\\\\' share price collectively could lift the index by 25 points,\" it said, adding that a recovery in TNB, which is facing persistent concern over the financial impact of tax issues, would further support the index.\\\\nA SEASONALLY STRONG FINISH\\\\nMalacca Securities Bhd research head Loui Low said the FBM KLCI has shown a tendency to close the year higher, with more than 85 per cent of December readings over the past two decades ending in positive territory and averaging gains of about 1.8 per cent.\\\\nHe said December is often viewed as a \"seasonally favourable period\" due to year-end window-dressing activities.\\\\n\"Considering these historical statistics and the FBM KLCI\\\\\\'s current market positioning, there is a reasonable expectation for a further upward movement of 30 to 40 points,\" he told Business Times.\\\\nA rally toward 1,700, however, would require an index gain of at least 100 points or more than five per cent from current levels.\\\\nConsequently, the more realistic target range for the index is projected to be between 1,650 and 1,660.\\\\n\"Ultimately, this trajectory will need the help from the banking sector and other index heavyweights as they approach the end of the year,\" said Low.\\\\nHe added that banks remain well-positioned to benefit from window dressing and could stage a notable rebound. Malaysia\\\\\\'s positive gross domestic product performance over recent quarters is also helping mitigate downside risks.\\\\nFOREIGN OUTFLOWS PERSIST\\\\nBank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said a 1,700 reading remains an ambitious target given the lack of strong support from foreign investors.\\\\nHe said foreign investors have been net sellers, totalling RM19.3 billion from January until Nov 21. This happened despite the FBM KLCI having price-to-earnings multiples of around 15 times, which is lower compared to the long-term average of 17 times.\\\\n\"As such, I would put 1,630 to 1,650 points as the baseline,\" he said.\\\\nHe also expects the net interest margin for banks to remain flat next year, partly due to the possibility of an overnight policy rate cut by Bank Negara Malaysia.\\\\n\"Given the expectation of moderate economic growth next year, one cannot totally discard the overnight policy cut option. As such, investors would continue to be cautious going into 2026,\" he said.\\\\nMIXED QUARTER FOR BANKS\\\\nThe latest financial results for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025, have been uneven for lenders.\\\\nMalayan Banking Bhd\\\\\\'s earnings rose 3.2 per cent to RM2.62 billion in the third quarter due to firmer operating income and lower impairment charges, although revenue dipped slightly to RM16.6 billion.\\\\nAMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank) posted a 6.8 per cent rise in net profit to RM534.58 million, lifted by higher non-interest income.

Net profit came in at RM116.23 million for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (2QFY2026), from RM128.28 million previously. Earnings per share fell to 3.18 sen from 3.51 sen. Quarterly revenue fell 7.89% year-on-year to RM1.73 billion from RM1.87 billion, dragged by weaker revenue contribution from most of its business segments, except convenience store chain. QL Resources is the master franchisee of the FamilyMart chain. For the first half of FY2026, QL Resources’ net profit fell 8% to RM216.83 million, from RM235.71 million in the previous corresponding period, while revenue dipped by 1.45% to RM3.44 billion. —QL Resources\\' 2Q net profit down 9% as most business segments report lower revenue\\\\nSime Darby Bhd(KL:SIME) said on Thursday its net profit in the recently-ended quarter was lower by 56% as a one-off land sale inflated earnings in the previous comparable month. Net profit for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (1QFY2026) was RM355 million. The company booked a RM458 million gain from the disposal of Malaysia Vision Valley land last year. However, earnings were also lower without the gains due to weaker sales of industrial equipment and vehicle sales. No dividend was announced. Quarterly revenue slipped to RM18.03 billion from RM18.26 billion a year ago. —Sime Darby 1Q profit down on weaker sales of industrial equipment, passenger cars\\\\nGenting Bhd(KL:GENTING) has posted a sharp 86.5% decline in its net profit for the third quarter, largely driven by weaker unrealised foreign exchange gains, lower interest income and higher depreciation. Net profit for the three months ended Sept 30, 2025 (3QFY2025) came in at RM30.3 million, compared to RM223.8 million a year earlier. Earnings per share dropped to 0.79 sen from 5.81 sen.

For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2025, Genting\\'s net profit declined 73.5% to RM278.42 million, compared with RM1.05 billion in the previous corresponding period, while revenue was marginally lower at RM20.77 billion from RM20.84 billion. —Genting posts steep drop in 3Q net profit, hit by forex and interest-income headwinds\\\\nGenting Malaysia Bhd’s (KL:GENM) third-quarter net profit fell 79% from a year earlier as the group recorded sharply lower unrealised foreign exchange gains. Net profit for the three months ended Sept 30, 2025 (3QFY2025) declined to RM119.69 million from RM569.16 million, as forex-related income dropped to RM2.8 million from RM601.8 million. Earnings per share stood at 2.11 sen, down from 10.04 sen in 3QFY2024. Revenue for the quarter increased 22.1% year-on-year to RM3.36 billion from RM2.75 billion, driven by higher business volume at Resorts World Genting in Malaysia and contributions from newly consolidated assets of Empire Resorts Inc in the US. For the nine-month period, Genting Malaysia\\'s net profit fell 14.1% year-on-year to RM609.02 million, while revenue rose 8.4% to RM8.87 billion. —Genting Malaysia’s 3Q net profit slumps 79% on lower forex gains\\\\nInari Amertron Bhd’s (KL:INARI) net profit jumped 113.5% for its first quarter, supported mainly by favourable movements in foreign exchange rates. Net profit for the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test player was RM51.5 million in the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (1QFY2026) versus RM24.1 million a year earlier. However, quarterly revenue fell 16% to RM325.8 million compared to RM388 million in the previous year, primarily due to lower loading volume across all business segments, where demand slowed down and fewer customer orders were handled. \\\\xa0—Inari’s 1Q net profit doubles on favourable forex movements, but posts lower top line on soft demand\\\\nMalakoff Corp Bhd(KL:MALAKOF) said a fire at the Tanjung Bin Energy plant in October is likely to drag on its performance in the financial year 2025. This after turbine issues at the plant saw it post a 67.5% drop in net profit for the third quarter. Net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (3QFY2025) fell to RM28.21 million from RM86.88 million a year earlier, due to lower energy payments following a steam turbine pipe leakage at the Tanjung Bin Energy plant. Lower investment returns and the absence of an insurance payout for turbine blade failure recognised last year reduced profits, partly offset by higher coal prices.\\\\xa0—Malakoff’s 3Q profit falls almost 68%, Tanjung Bin Energy fire to weigh on full-year earnings\\\\nBerjaya Corp Bhd(KL:BJCORP), the consumer conglomerate of tycoon Tan Sri Vincent Tan, extended its losses into the sixth quarter in a row as tax expenses erased operating profit.

I understand their focus on historical risk-adjusted returns, particularly the Sharpe ratio. However, I continue to disagree with their overall assessment. While historical performance provides valuable context, my fundamental analysis suggests that the underlying business fundamentals warrant caution, and I believe the Valuation agent is still underestimating these risks. The fact that they are running a shorter-term analysis suggests they are also acknowledging some increased uncertainty, which reinforces my concerns.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My fundamental analysis adds a crucial layer of scrutiny by examining the underlying business drivers and sustainability of performance. Specifically, my RAG analysis has consistently highlighted concerns regarding gross margin and potential credit risks. These are not merely backward-looking metrics but indicators of potential future challenges. While the Sharpe ratio reflects past performance, it doesn't necessarily guarantee future success, especially if the underlying business fundamentals are weakening. I believe the Valuation agent's reliance on historical data may not fully capture the evolving risk profile of RHB Bank.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: Considering all perspectives and my previous analysis, I maintain my HOLD recommendation with 70% confidence. The Valuation agent's reduced confidence in their BUY recommendation further validates my concerns. While the historical risk-adjusted returns are a positive factor, the fundamental risks I've identified, particularly regarding gross margin and asset quality, remain significant enough to warrant a cautious approach. For a moderate investor seeking a balance between growth and stability, a HOLD recommendation is still the most appropriate, in my opinion.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your sentiment analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

While the Fundamental agent focuses on inherent business risks, sentiment reflects how these risks are being interpreted by the broader market. The fact that sentiment hasn't turned decisively negative despite the identified fundamental concerns suggests that the market isn't panicking, but it also isn't overly optimistic. This reinforces the HOLD recommendation, as a BUY would require stronger positive sentiment to justify taking on the identified risks.

\\'TheEdge\\', \\'body\\': \"This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 22, 2025 - December 28, 2025\\\\nMALAYSIA’S stock market performance has been relatively flat this year, lagging behind the strong rallies seen in regional peers such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia, whose indices have surged to record highs.\\\\nThe benchmark FBM KLCI is up only marginally year to date (YTD), weighed down by market uncertainty stemming from US tariffs and lacklustre corporate earnings. The broader Emas Index, which tracks Main Market stocks, is down 4% over the same period, while the ACE Index has fallen 11.3%.\\\\nThe FBM KLCI has been largely supported by heavyweight banking stocks, with the Financial Services Index remaining stable throughout the year. RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) led the pack with a YTD gain of 23.3%, followed by AMMB Holdings Bhd (KL:AMBANK) (+20.1%), Malayan Banking Bhd (KL:MAYBANK) (+6.9%) and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) (+5.3%).\\\\nDecember is typically a month of gains for equities, buoyed by portfolio managers’ efforts to enhance year-end performance through window dressing. The FBM KLCI has gained 2.3% so far this month.\\\\nNg Zhu Hann, CEO of Tradeview Capital Sdn Bhd, observes that the market sentiment this year has leaned more towards profit-taking, amid the net foreign fund outflow of about RM21 billion YTD \\\\xad— the largest since the net outflow of RM24.6 billion in 2020 — against net buying of RM20.3 billion by institutional funds.\\\\n“That is a very alarming level. While one could argue that some equity outflows have moved into the bond market, it does not send a very healthy signal to the equity market, and that is my biggest concern,” he tells The Edge.\\\\nHe says local institutional funds have played their part in supporting the market, but their capacity is limited, while retail participation continues to decline.\\\\n“As for local funds, they have done what they can to provide support, but there is only so much they can do. Retail participation also keeps coming down,” he adds.\\\\nForeign investors have remained net sellers of Malaysian equities in the final quarter of this year, with net outflows of RM4.32 billion as at Dec 12, compared with RM4.3 billion in 3Q, according to MBSB Research. In 1Q and 2Q, foreign investors net sold RM9.96 billion and RM2.16 billion worth of equities respectively. In 2024, net foreign selling amounted to RM4.21 billion.\\\\nOn the prospects of a reversal in foreign fund flows in 2026, Ng says this will largely depend on the US interest rate trajectory, particularly whether cuts exceed current expectations of at least three reductions, which could bring the key policy rate closer to 2.5%. The US federal funds rate is currently in the range of 3.5% to 3.75% after three cuts this year.\\\\n“If rate cuts are in line with expectations, I don’t see a significant influx of foreign funds into our equity market in the near term, because if they were going to come in, they would have already done so,” he says.\\\\nHe notes that the strengthening ringgit also reduces the appeal to foreign investors, unless there is a strategic shift from bonds to equities.\\\\n“It comes down to the rate differentials as fund managers seek the highest possible returns with the lowest risk. For now, the US bond market remains attractive, at least until further rate cuts materialise,” he adds.\\\\nAmong the top-performing large-cap stocks YTD are 99 Speed Mart Retail Holdings Bhd (KL:99SMART) (+45.4%), United Plantations Bhd (KL:UTDPLT) (+45.2%), Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd (KL:PMETAL) (+42.2%), Malayan Cement Bhd (KL:MCEMENT) and Sunway Construction Group Bhd (KL:SUNCON) (32.1%).\\\\n99 Speed Mart’s strong share price performance has been underpinned by its solid earnings, which hit a record high of RM160.65 million in the July-to-September quarter on the back of higher sales and store counts. Press Metal is on track to post record earnings in the financial year ending Dec 31, 2026 (FY2026), driven by elevated aluminium prices and easing alumina costs, after posting a 15% rise in 9MFY2025 net profit to RM1.51 billion, according to Hong Leong Investment Bank Research’s Dec 15 note.\\\\nAmid broader market uncertainty, real estate investment trusts (REITs) have emerged as the best-performing sector on Bursa Malaysia, with IGB REIT (KL:IGBREIT) and Sunway REIT (KL:SUNREIT) chalking up YTD gains of 30.2% and 27.8% respectively. Notably, the Bursa Malaysia REIT Index is up more than 7% over the same period.\\\\nOn the flip side, selling pressure has weighed on several stocks, including PETRONAS Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM) (-31.9%), IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) (-25.9%), YTL Power International Bhd (KL:YTLPOWR) (-24%), YTL Corp Bhd (KL:YTL) (-19.5%) and Genting Bhd (KL:GENTING) (-19.5%).\\\\nPETRONAS Chemicals has continued to suffer from margin compression due to ongoing oversupply and weak demand, while IJM’s financials have been dragged down by lower contribution from property development and port operations. YTL and its majority-owned utility arm YTL Power began their new financial year (FY2026) with moderate earnings growth as lower operating expenses and finance costs offset a dip in revenue.\\\\nMalacca Securities head of research Loui Low notes that the local bourse has performed reasonably well since the start of the month, in line with historical trends that show the benchmark index typically ends December in positive territory.\\\\n“The current FBM KLCI level is within our expectations. We hope it can close at 1,660 points by year end,” he says.\\\\nLooking ahead to 2026, Low believes investors will need to wait for more catalysts before trading activity picks up meaningfully.\\\\n“Third-quarter corporate results were quite neutral and failed to capture much investor attention. Furthermore, several sectors may be affected by the strong ringgit. So I think for now, trading is rather scattered,” he says.\\\\nLow sees opportunities in selected technology stocks such as UWC Bhd (KL:UWC), Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) and ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), all of which recently delivered stronger financial results.\\\\nHe advises investors to position for the consumer sector to benefit from Visit Malaysia 2026 (VM2026).\\\\n“Some consumer stocks could be suitable for long-term strategies. We need to see whether earnings can be sustained going into the first quarter of 2026. With the ringgit’s current strength, input costs should be lower for the next couple of months, which would support earnings,” he says.\\\\nLow also prefers companies linked to smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) technology adoption, including public space networked systems provider ITMAX System Bhd (KL:ITMAX) and intelligent asset management and water technology solutions provider Insights Analytics Bhd (KL:IAB).\\\\nTA Securities also expects the FBM KLCI to end the year at 1,660 points, with upward momentum extending into 2026. “Greater clarity on US trade policy, ample liquidity from ongoing monetary easing, and renewed foreign inflows are set to bolster investor confidence and drive further gains in the index next year,” the research house says in a Dec 17 note.\\\\nTA Securities highlights that Malaysia’s low foreign shareholding presents upside optionality for substantial inflows when global risk appetite recovers. Foreign shareholding of Malaysian equities stood at 19% in November, not far from the 2003 trough of 18.1%.\\\\nThe research house’s key investment themes for 2026 are energy transition, digital economy and infrastructure, robust consumption and tourism, fundamentally solid blue-chip stocks, as well as small- and mid-cap growth stocks.\\\\nApex Securities head of research Ong Tze Hern identifies three key themes for the local equity market in 2026, namely tourism, affordable consumption and renewable energy.\\\\n“As VM2026 kicks off, this will benefit the aviation, hospitality and REIT sectors,” he says, noting that more than RM700 million has been set aside for tourism under Budget 2026, including RM500 million specifically for VM2026, as well as a tax relief of RM1,000 on individual income tax for entrance fees to local tourism attractions and cultural programmes.\\\\nOng says selected consumer players are expected to benefit from various government initiatives aimed at supporting the low-income group. Nearly RM20 billion has been allocated to assistance programmes this year, including the Rahmah Cash Contribution (STR), the Rahmah Basic Contribution (Sara) and aid from the Social Welfare Department (JKM).\\\\nIn renewable energy, he favours companies involved in ground-mounted solar panels, as rooftop solar players will need to comply with mandatory battery requirements for self-consumption users from January 2026 onwards, which means higher investment outlay is required.\\\\nOverall, Ong believes stronger catalysts — including more robust economic growth — are needed for the FBM KLCI to breach the 1,700-point level.\\\\n“I don’t think window dressing alone will push the FBM KLCI above 1,700 points. At best, it may close near that level,” he says.\\\\nAreca Capital Sdn Bhd CEO Danny Wong expects selected construction and data centre-linked stocks to outperform in 2026, supported by a healthy job pipeline. He also highlights tourism-related plays that could benefit companies such as Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (KL:F&AMP;N), Nestlé (Malaysia) Bhd (KL:NESTLE) and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (KL:CARLSBG).\\\\nMeanwhile, Tradeview’s Ng is positive on the renewable energy, utility, financial and healthcare sectors, but is cautious about the REIT outlook for 2026 as the withholding tax concession on REIT distributions is set to expire on Dec 31 this year, with no announcement on an extension so far. “If REIT income becomes taxable, that would impact the returns to unitholders,” he points out.\\\\nHe adds that the local equity market will need to rely more heavily on the domestic economy, rather than global conditions.\\\\n“We need to be able to sustain domestic consumption and investment, instead of relying on global macro events to shape our prospects. This means the government needs to look into supporting small and medium enterprises to keep them competitive,” he elaborates.\\\\nSave bysubscribingto us for \\\\n      your print and/or \\\\n      digital copy.\\\\nP/S: The Edge is also available onApple\\'s App StoreandAndroid\\'s Google Play.\"}, {\\'headline\\': \\'FBM KLCI breaks winning streak on profit-taking\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 26, 17, 26), \\'source\\': \\'TheStar\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: The FBM KLCI snapped its winning streak on profit-taking, ending the session slightly lower as selling pressure weighed on the broader market.\\\\nThe 30-stock closed 1.21 points, or 0.07%, lower at 1,677.10 after trading between an intraday high of 1,678.29 and a low of 1,670.83.

Moreover, most banks still maintain fairly sizeable management overlays to buffer against any further deterioration in asset quality.\\\\nCorrespondingly, we forecast aggregate return on average equity (ROAE) to average 10.3% in 2026E and 2027E respectively, up from 10.2% in 2025E.\\\\nDividend yields are decent, averaging about 5.5% for FY25E and 5.8% for FY26E. We project dividend yields of more than 5% for most banks this financial year, except for Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (KL:ABMB) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (KL:HLBANK) at about four-plus per cent. Meanwhile, valuations are still undemanding, in our view, with most banks trading close to -1 standard deviation to their forward PERs’ historical mean.\\\\nWe expect an improved operating environment for CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s (KL:CIMB) operations amid lower net interest margin pressure in Singapore and a stable economic outlook in Malaysia and Indonesia. AMMB Holdings Bhd’s (KL:AMBANK) focus on proactive funding cost management and business banking operations should contribute to growth momentum, as it strives for higher dividend payouts. We expect improved earnings momentum in the second half of FY26 for Alliance Bank on lower credit costs, and project a three-year net profit CAGR of 7% on robust loan growth and more stable margins.\\\\nHaving recently upgraded our calls on several stocks, we now have “buy” calls on Alliance Bank, AmBank, CIMB, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd (KL:HLFG), Public Bank Bhd (KL:PBBANK) and RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK).

RWNYC is expected to offer live table games in July 2026, possibly earlier. We had expected this win and factored in RM1 per share valuation from this win into our target price. Hence, we are maintaining our FY25-26F forecasts, target price of RM3 and “outperform” rating.\\\\nOur earlier estimated funding gap for the project was US$2 billion (RM8.3 billion) to US$3 billion. However, following the exit of MGM Resorts from the bid, stronger earnings and cash flows from being New York City’s only full-service casino until around 2030, the gap should narrow to about US$1 billion to US$2 billion, or smaller. As such, the initial fear of substantial dilution is lowered. In any case, GENM owns 15 acres of Miami land and 270 million treasury shares worth US$100 million to US$200 million, depending on the selling price. GENM can also issue up to 10% of new shares without triggering a rights issue to raise another US$300 million to US$400 million.\\\\nSeparately, Genting Bhd’s (KL:GENTING) shareholding in GENM has risen to 73% after the closure of its mandatory general offer yesterday (Dec 1).

Management at the briefing pointed to quarterly losses for its dairy farm business peaking by about 2QFY9/26F.\\\\nThird, we see F&N’s cumulative free cash flow of RM1.6 billion between FY26 and FY28 providing room for higher dividend payout ratios beginning FY27F.\\\\nWe raise our core net profit estimate for F&N by 2.6% in FY28F to reflect a lower tax rate as the dairy farm business begins to generate profits, allowing for tax losses and incentives for its dairy venture to be utilised.

Major institutions are deploying multimillion-ringgit AI systems for fraud detection and customer analytics, to automate processes and to enhance branch services.\\\\nBank Negara Malaysia’s “Artificial Intelligence in the Malaysian Financial Sector” discussion paper, released on Aug 5, reports that 71% of local banks now operate at least one AI application, up from 56% a year earlier. This signals an industry shift from the pilot phase to production.\\\\n“Looking ahead, more than 60% of banking institutions and insurers and takaful operators view AI as a strategic priority at their institutions in the next one to three years,” the central bank notes.\\\\nIt attributes the growth in AI applications to the increased interest in exploring generative AI (Gen AI) applications, such as ChatGPT. There has also been growing interest in agentic AI, which refers to AI systems capable of taking autonomous actions to achieve a goal, such as an AI that automatically freezes a suspicious transaction upon detecting fraud risk.\\\\nPwC Malaysia financial services consulting partner Neha Mani tells The Edge that AI is now a significant priority for most Malaysian financial institutions, which is reflected in the “leadership time, organisational resources and investment” dedicated to its development.\\\\n“Investments are being made to ready the banks to leverage AI solutions at scale, such as investments towards cloud infrastructure and building a data infrastructure. Some leading financial institutions have even set up SWAT teams within their environment to help them identify and deploy use cases,” says Neha.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK), for instance, reported in its 2024 integrated report that it invested RM868.7 million in digital transformation and IT infrastructure between 2020 and 2024, with the digital transaction rate reaching 92.2% last year across a user base of over 2.9 million.\\\\nNeha says the biggest difference between local FIs and their foreign counterparts is the scale of their AI deployment. “US banks, for example, have already scaled AI-based tools in areas such as risk and fraud. Overall, organisational and leadership readiness is at different maturity levels across markets,” she adds.\\\\nLeading banks in AI transformation are adopting a strategic, large-scale and business-driven approach with “comprehensive changes instead of isolated initiatives” that distinguishes them from institutions still in the pilot phase, she says.\\\\nAs an example, she cites a global card issuer that uses AI and machine learning for real-time credit card fraud detection, and a major American retail bank that utilises an AI or machine-learning-driven virtual assistant to provide personalised financial insights and assistance with tasks like bill payments and budgeting.\\\\nWhile digital banks are “AI-native by design”, some traditional institutions are matching their pace. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC) is an example. It was the first bank in Singapore to establish an AI unit in 2018 to build in-house capabilities. That has since evolved into the bank’s group data office, where AI is a core strategic lever for productivity, revenue growth and risk reduction.\\\\nAccording to OCBC’s 2024 annual report and an interview with its head of group data office Donald MacDonald, AI now drives about six million decisions daily across the bank, from personalised credit card offers to fraud detection. Its early start has accelerated the use of Gen AI over the past two years.\\\\nIn November 2023, OCBC said it became the first Singapore bank to launch a Gen AI chatbot, known as “OCBC GPT”, to support 30,000 employees in writing, research and ideation. This came after earlier deployments of internally built Gen AI tools for coding, document summarisation, call transcription and querying internal knowledge bases that have boosted productivity by up to 50%.\\\\nAs OCBC continues deepening its AI and Gen AI capabilities, it is strengthening governance to ensure adherence to FEAT (fair, ethical, accountable, transparent) principles, with all AI models undergoing regular accuracy reviews and rigorous testing to prevent bias.\\\\n“I work very closely with all the different unit heads to [use] the data to make better decisions. Increasingly, it’s about how we can use the data, especially AI, to transform the processes to make [the work] more efficient,” says MacDonald.\\\\nHis team of about 150 people, comprising data engineers, analysts and scientists, is responsible for data literacy alongside managing the bank’s data science platform and strategy.\\\\n“AI is applied across all aspects of OCBC’s business, namely in revenue generation, customer investment decisions, cost reduction and productivity improvement, as well as risk reduction. In the third area, we apply AI to reduce risk in areas like credit scoring as well as fraud and scam detection, anti-money laundering and things like that. These are key focuses at OCBC.\\\\n“We measure the value of all of our use cases which, going by the [collective] value of our use cases, AI generates [a significant amount] in quantifiable benefits every year,” says MacDonald, adding such AI-driven gains that are measured as “quantifiable benefits” run into the hundreds of millions of Singapore dollars each year.\\\\nOCBC’s strategy focus is agentic AI, which can automate complex, end-to-end workflow and reasoning models for strategic decision-making.\\\\n“Agentic AI is the thing that’s going to unlock complex workflow. So, if you’re in our financial crime space and you need to investigate a suspicious transaction and write a report about it, an agent could do that for you. If you were in a command centre and someone asked for a fee waiver, the agent could evaluate that and provide the rationale,” MacDonald explains.\\\\n“Then there is OCBC’s strategic decision-making, like how OCBC should be positioning its balance sheet or where OCBC should be investing its money amid all that’s been going on with the US Federal Reserve. So, rather than having just humans thinking about what we should do, we’re also looking at using reasoning models to handle some of these strategic decisions.”\\\\nHe also sees AI transforming customer interaction with banks.\\\\n“As Gen AI understands natural language, it is able to have a reasonably smart conversation with you now. You could ask, ‘OCBC, what happened in the market last night and what should I do?’ Because the agent knows your profile, the equities you like and your risk appetite, it would give you a recommendation,” MacDonald says.\\\\nFor institutions that are digital-first, such as newly licensed digital banks, AI is embedded from the start.\\\\nFoong Chee Mun, chief product officer of the YTL-Sea Digital Bank Project — one of five entities awarded a digital banking licence in Malaysia — notes this difference at Ryt Bank, which was launched by YTL Group and Sea Ltd as the world’s first AI-powered bank.\\\\n“At Ryt Bank, AI isn’t a layer we added later, it’s the foundation. Every operational flow, from onboarding to risk and customer service, was designed assuming a machine partner is always in the loop. Our core systems speak natural language, not just code or APIs (application programming interfaces).\\\\nThat allows customers to perform transactions conversationally, and it allows our internal systems such as credit, fraud and compliance to constantly learn and adapt in real time,” says Foong, who is also CEO of YTL AI Labs.\\\\nDigital banks rely more on automation and data science teams than on conventional branch or operations staff. Ryt Bank was designed “around intelligence itself as the new infrastructure”, meaning its teams are structured differently from those of a traditional bank.\\\\n“What’s exciting for us is that we got to reimagine how banking could be built from the ground up in this generative AI era. We weren’t constrained by legacy structures or branches. That means our teams look quite different from a traditional bank,” Foong acknowledges.\\\\nOver half of Ryt Bank’s workforce comprises engineers, AI experts and data scientists, with safety being the core of its processes.\\\\n“For us, safety isn’t a compliance checklist; it’s part of how we engineer. Every product, every model and every decision system is designed with that mindset from day one. In short, we’re structured less like a traditional bank and more like a technology company: intelligent, data-driven and safe by design,” Foong says.\\\\nThe path to AI adoption is not without its hurdles. PwC Malaysia’s partner for digital, cloud and data Norliza Mazni Nawi points out a fundamental issue: data quality.\\\\n“AI models are only as effective as the data on which they are built. Without rich, accurate data, their potential is limited, stunting banks’ ability to make smart decisions and provide valuable insights. While we are seeing local banks experimenting with AI use cases and offering personalised services to customers, poor data quality remains one of the top challenges contributing to AI project failures,” Norliza says.\\\\nFrom a digital banking perspective, Foong highlights the complexity of conversational AI, where operators must understand intent, tone and context across diverse linguistic backgrounds, rather than merely predicting numbers.\\\\n“The hardest part is that language is messy. People don’t always speak in neat, structured sentences, often mixing English, Malay, Mandarin, even slang, all in the same message. So, one of the biggest challenges is getting the model to truly understand what users mean, not just what they say. That’s why we spend a lot of time fine-tuning for the Malaysian context, culture and code-switching patterns,” Foong shares.\\\\nSafety and reliability are critical, as any misunderstanding instantly affects trust.\\\\n“You can’t afford a wrong tone or a misleading response, especially in banking. So, we’ve built strong human-in-the-loop systems, content filters and fallback mechanisms to make sure the AI stays accurate and aligned with our values,” he says.\\\\nPwC’s Neha observes that AI offers banks quick and tangible returns on investment or ROI, not just through real-time fraud management (which reduces financial losses and operational risks) but also the automation of repetitive tasks — such as compliance checks, data entry and report generation — that lowers labour costs, accelerates processing times and minimises errors.\\\\n“Institutions that embrace Gen AI early are likely to experience improvements in operational efficiencies and cost reductions, while also managing risks more effectively with the help of predictive analytics.

Commonly, going beyond borders, it is shaped by the children’s learning environment, generational security and the potential for long-term opportunities.\\\\nA modest home near a child’s university in London, a townhouse in Sydney as a hedge against currency volatility or a simple desire to hold assets in markets defined by institutional stability and robust liquidity. What once seemed aspirational is now an emerging norm among affluent Malaysian families.\\\\nThe allure of buying property abroad often requires Malaysians to navigate foreign tax regimes, manage foreign exchange rates and comply with unfamiliar local regulations. For some, this exciting milestone also means engaging subject-matter experts to complete the purchase of their ideal residential home abroad.\\\\nIt is precisely this friction that RHB Banking Group, through its Community Banking arm, aims to remove. In a candid conversation, Jeffrey Ng, Managing Director of Group Community Banking at RHB, shares the group’s strategic shift towards holistic wealth management, where sophisticated cross-border solutions such as overseas property financing are becoming a defining feature of its premier client offering.\\\\n“I see this all the time,” says Jeffrey. “For most Malaysians, purchasing property abroad is not just a financial decision. It is an investment in a meaningful milestone — supporting a child’s education, strengthening a family’s future or embracing a new stage of their personal journey.”\\\\nHe speaks with the calm assurance of someone who has walked alongside Malaysian families navigating similar uncertainties, each trying to make global decisions while relying on local knowledge, local resources and local concerns. This depth of experience, he says, is now shaping the bank’s approach to serving its premier and affluent clientele.\\\\nJeffrey points out a simple truth: Malaysian wealth today is no longer neatly segmented between “domestic” and “global”. It is layered, fluid and personal.\\\\nEntrepreneurs who established their businesses at home now seek assets in markets they trust. Mid-career professionals aspire to more diversified earnings. Parents seek stability and reassurance while their children pursue education abroad. And retirees — many with years of international engagement — are thoughtfully extending their long-term interests overseas.\\\\nJeffrey offers a vision of premier banking services that is no longer just about picking stocks and bonds, but about holistically architecting a client’s entire financial journey, from their business and family needs to their global aspirations.\\\\nAt the heart of this vision lies a powerful tool: sophisticated cross-border financing solutions designed to turn formidable intricacies into manageable opportunities.\\\\n“We serve the entire spectrum — the family, business and individual,” says Jeffrey, articulating the bank’s core philosophy. “If you have any needs, whether it be wealth management or financing, we want to bring it together seamlessly.\\\\n“The goal is not to push products. It’s to create coherence in a client’s financial journey.”\\\\nThis ethos underpins RHB’s broader “PROGRESS27” strategy, where retail wealth management has been earmarked as a high-growth engine. The bank is aiming for double-digit fee income growth and plans to double its investment and bancassurance assets under management (AUM) within three years.\\\\nOne of the key drivers of this growth, Jeffrey reveals, is the synergistic flow between RHB’s strong SME and commercial banking base, as well as its premier wealth management.\\\\n“We have built a strong SME, commercial and corporate client base, and many of these relationships organically flow into our retail wealth management business,” he explains.\\\\n“Behind many of the [corporates and SMEs] is a founder, a director and a family, who are also high-net-worth individuals in their own right, and their personal wealth decisions are closely intertwined with their business life,” he adds.\\\\nJeffrey says this natural overlap gives RHB a unique vantage point. “When you understand a client’s business cycle — their cash flow rhythms, expansion plans, risk appetite — you understand them. That enables us to architect their personal wealth strategy with far greater precision. Their corporate journey informs their personal portfolio, and vice versa.”\\\\nThis, he says, is what makes RHB’s integrated model powerful. “It allows us to help clients translate the success they’ve created in their business into a well-structured, global personal wealth plan.”\\\\nOne of the most tangible examples of this philosophy is the bank’s cross-border mortgage solution: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan.\\\\nJeffrey identifies the UK and Australia as the primary markets, driven by education, familiarity and a search for diversified returns.\\\\n“Many parents studied in these countries, and now their children are going there too,” he notes. “Which is precisely why they are turning their attention to diversifying their portfolios and securing exposure that extends beyond the onshore market.”\\\\nThe property loan specifically targets prime residential properties in Zones 1 to 3 of London and within 30km of Sydney or Melbourne’s central business district (CBD).\\\\n“One of the key considerations is currency exposure,” he explains. “For instance, financing in pound sterling, you’re subject not only to exchange rate fluctuations, but also varying interest-rate regimes.”\\\\nThe appeal, however, lies in the structure of the product. RHB’s overseas property financing is both denominated and disbursed in the ringgit, providing a safeguard against currency volatility. “This effectively eliminates future forex fluctuations,” Jeffrey explains.\\\\nThis ringgit-denominated shield, combined with high financing margins and flexible features, repositions an international property acquisition from an unpredictable venture into a strategic, calculable asset. It is a surprisingly straightforward idea — and its simplicity is its strength.\\\\nThe offering is designed for flexibility and accessibility. For eligible Malaysian residents and premier customers, the bank offers a high margin of financing — up to 85% for UK properties and 75% for Australian ones, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nThe loan tenure can extend up to 30 years or until the borrower turns 70, with a flexible “redraw” feature that allows clients to prepay and access excess funds, providing both interest savings and financial agility.\\\\nFurthermore, an early release option allows clients to lock in favourable exchange rates during the construction phase, adding another layer of strategic financial management.\\\\nClients appreciate the loan’s flexi features: higher financing margins, redraw capabilities for liquidity and an early release option that lets them lock in favourable FX rates during construction.\\\\n“It’s about giving control back to the customer,” says Jeffrey. “When you’re thousands of miles away, certainty matters.”\\\\nOne topic Jeffrey approaches cautiously and refreshingly is digital assets.\\\\nA commitment to consistency does not mean shying away from innovation. In fact, Jeffrey is a strong advocate for continuously educating clients on alternative and innovative asset classes to ensure their portfolios are future-proof.\\\\n“We cannot ignore digital assets,” he says matter-of-factly, revealing that RHB has already launched unitised funds invested in Bitcoin ETFs. “But it must be done responsibly.\\\\n“We launched that early this year and we’ve got some good traction … it’s for a selected segment of customers. Not everyone will be suitable for it due to its volatility, but I think that is also another example of us coming up with alternative innovative asset classes for their consideration.”\\\\nBeyond cryptocurrency, he pointed to the growing demand for structured products — specialised, non-unitised offerings based on equities, commodities or credits. These products can be engineered to offer principal protection for the prudent or leveraged upside for those seeking higher returns, all carefully matched to a client’s risk profile.\\\\nThis educational journey also extends to the foundational pillar of wealth preservation.\\\\nBut Jeffrey repeatedly circles back to the fundamentals. “You can’t run away from protection,” he asserts. “A single unexpected event or personal uncertainty can set back decades of wealth building.”\\\\nThrough insurance and legacy planning, the bank helps clients build a defensive bulwark around their assets, ensuring that accumulated wealth is preserved and transferred efficiently to the next generation.\\\\nThis groundedness, acknowledging innovation without losing sight of risk is what affluent Malaysian investors quietly look for but rarely hear articulated so clearly.\\\\nUnderpinning all of RHB’s wealth management strategies is a disciplined investment philosophy that prioritises long-term, steady growth over chasing short-term windfalls.\\\\n“I think the main theme that we usually advocate is that wealth management is about consistent returns rather than one-off,” Jeffrey emphasises. “So consistent returns would mean there’s obviously going to be diversification.\\\\n“So this is where we come in and we propose what we deem is a model portfolio for our customers that fits their risk and their life stage. I think that’s very important.”\\\\nThis client-centric model means a 30-year-old entrepreneur will have a radically different portfolio from a 60-year-old preparing for retirement. The common thread is not the assets themselves, but the goal of predictable, risk-adjusted growth tailored to individual circumstances.\\\\nIn an industry racing to automate, RHB is making a significant bet on a different future: one where cutting-edge technology does not replace the relationship managers, but radically empowers them.\\\\nJeffrey’s perspective is pragmatic. “I don’t believe personal relationships can be displaced,” he says. “What we feel is that a relationship manager and technology should coexist. Technology actually helps complement and enable us to deliver an exceptional level of service.”\\\\nHe describes a powerful synergy where AI and data analytics handle the tedious work. “Why spend a few hours trying to prepare a presentation to a customer when technology can actually help you put it together?” he asks.\\\\nInstead, AI modules help relationship managers size up a customer’s profile and generate proposed portfolios that fit their risk criteria.\\\\nRHB now uses AI-driven tools to prepare customer profiles, run simulations and generate recommended portfolios — work that used to take hours.\\\\nHowever, Jeffrey was clear that this is “just merely triggers”. The final, crucial value is delivered by the human in the loop. “It’s then left to the relationship managers to actually … spend more time engaging with the customer, giving context and insights, who listens, who explains trade-offs, and having a more thorough decision on it.”\\\\nBy reducing administrative load, RHB frees its relationship managers to spend more time on conversations that actually matter: explaining the nuances of a structured product, guiding a client through the implications of a new tax policy on their overseas rental unit, rolling out a multi-currency plan for a child’s schooling, or providing reassurance during market volatility.\\\\nTechnology provides the data, but the relationship managers provide the wisdom, context and trust. It is a hybrid approach that acknowledges both the power of data and the irreplaceability of human judgement.\\\\nWhen asked what comes next, Jeffrey doesn’t hesitate. “We’re preparing for the generational wealth transfer.”\\\\nHe highlighted the imminent large generational wealth transfer as a critical window, noting that RHB is developing frameworks for family office services to help support this shift, from succession planning to multi-generational advisory.\\\\n“Islamic wealth management is another frontier, one that we see growing rapidly. It’s about purposeful distribution, purification and aligning wealth with values,” he says.\\\\nFor RHB, the foray into solutions like ringgit-denominated overseas property financing is more than a product launch. It is a symbol of a broader ambition.\\\\nIn a world of increasing interconnectedness, the bank is positioning itself not just as a manager of capital, but as a strategic partner that builds bridges — across borders and asset classes, and between cutting-edge technology and timeless human insight.\\\\nThrough personalisation, RHB is building a new architecture for wealth, designed to stand the test of time and global uncertainty.\\\\nRHB Bank Bhd offers a specialised financial solution for Malaysian residents and premier customers looking to purchase residential property in key international markets: the RHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan. This product is designed to simplify cross-border investment by mitigating major risks and providing flexible terms.\\\\nEligible properties must be residential, over 50 sq m and be freehold or leasehold with at least 70 years remaining on the lease.\\\\nA cornerstone of this offering is its ringgit-denominated structure. By taking the loan and making repayments in ringgit, borrowers are safeguarded from the volatility of foreign exchange rates, providing certainty in their long-term financial planning.\\\\nKey financial terms include:\\\\nHigh financing margin:Investors can secure up to 85% financing for UK properties and 75% for Australian properties, inclusive of 5% Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance (MRTA).\\\\nSubstantial loan amounts: The loan amounts are significant, with minimums from RM500,000 in Australia and RM800,000 in the UK.\\\\nLong tenure:A lengthy loan tenure of up to 30 years, or until the borrower reaches age 70, provides manageable repayment schedules.The product also features valuable flexibility. The “Full Flexi” option allows for prepayments and the ability to redraw excess funds, leading to interest savings.Furthermore, an early release option is available during a property’s construction phase, allowing clients to lock in favourable foreign exchange rates ahead of the property’s completion.This comprehensive package positions RHB’s loan as a strategic tool for Malaysians to confidently expand their real estate portfolios into stable, high-demand international markets while managing currency and financing complexities.\\\\nRHB MY1 Full Flexi Overseas Property Home Loan\\\\nScan / Click\\\\nBecoming an RHB Premier customer and unlocking a world of privileged banking services is designed to be easy and accessible.

Prior to that, it traded in the mid-1,800 range in 2018 and had climbed to its historic peak of 1,883.90 in July 2014\\\\nThe prolonged retreat since then, driven by a mix of domestic and external headwinds and the pandemic-driven cycle, means that any return to the 1,700 zone would be viewed as a sign of a market regaining lost ground after more than half a decade.\\\\nHEAVYWEIGHTS HOLD THE KEY\\\\nMaybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) said the local bourse could grind closer to the psychologically important 1,700 level by year-end if heavyweight banks and Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) finally play catch-up after a year of underperformance.\\\\nThe research house is keeping its year-end 2025 target for the benchmark index at 1,660, representing about three per cent upside from current levels, but said a move toward 1,700 is \"possible\" if several large caps rerate together.\\\\n\"At this stage, we think 1,700 remains attainable provided there is positive price movement in the banks, TNB, Gamuda Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd and Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd,\" it said.\\\\nThe target is anchored on a 15 times price-earnings valuation of projected 2026 earnings.\\\\nMaybank IB said the FBM KLCI has been trading in a narrow band of 1,610 to 1,630 in recent weeks, even as nearly 40 per cent of its component stocks have delivered share price gains this year.\\\\nThe main drag has come from the banking sector and TNB, which together account for about 30 per cent of the index\\\\\\'s weight.\\\\n\"Every five per cent increase in the top three banks\\\\\\' share price collectively could lift the index by 25 points,\" it said, adding that a recovery in TNB, which is facing persistent concern over the financial impact of tax issues, would further support the index.\\\\nA SEASONALLY STRONG FINISH\\\\nMalacca Securities Bhd research head Loui Low said the FBM KLCI has shown a tendency to close the year higher, with more than 85 per cent of December readings over the past two decades ending in positive territory and averaging gains of about 1.8 per cent.\\\\nHe said December is often viewed as a \"seasonally favourable period\" due to year-end window-dressing activities.\\\\n\"Considering these historical statistics and the FBM KLCI\\\\\\'s current market positioning, there is a reasonable expectation for a further upward movement of 30 to 40 points,\" he told Business Times.\\\\nA rally toward 1,700, however, would require an index gain of at least 100 points or more than five per cent from current levels.\\\\nConsequently, the more realistic target range for the index is projected to be between 1,650 and 1,660.\\\\n\"Ultimately, this trajectory will need the help from the banking sector and other index heavyweights as they approach the end of the year,\" said Low.\\\\nHe added that banks remain well-positioned to benefit from window dressing and could stage a notable rebound. Malaysia\\\\\\'s positive gross domestic product performance over recent quarters is also helping mitigate downside risks.\\\\nFOREIGN OUTFLOWS PERSIST\\\\nBank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said a 1,700 reading remains an ambitious target given the lack of strong support from foreign investors.\\\\nHe said foreign investors have been net sellers, totalling RM19.3 billion from January until Nov 21. This happened despite the FBM KLCI having price-to-earnings multiples of around 15 times, which is lower compared to the long-term average of 17 times.\\\\n\"As such, I would put 1,630 to 1,650 points as the baseline,\" he said.\\\\nHe also expects the net interest margin for banks to remain flat next year, partly due to the possibility of an overnight policy rate cut by Bank Negara Malaysia.\\\\n\"Given the expectation of moderate economic growth next year, one cannot totally discard the overnight policy cut option. As such, investors would continue to be cautious going into 2026,\" he said.\\\\nMIXED QUARTER FOR BANKS\\\\nThe latest financial results for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025, have been uneven for lenders.\\\\nMalayan Banking Bhd\\\\\\'s earnings rose 3.2 per cent to RM2.62 billion in the third quarter due to firmer operating income and lower impairment charges, although revenue dipped slightly to RM16.6 billion.\\\\nAMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank) posted a 6.8 per cent rise in net profit to RM534.58 million, lifted by higher non-interest income. Group revenue increased to RM1.29 billion.\\\\nCIMB Holdings Bhd recorded modest gains in the quarter.

Maybank IB said earnings momentum is holding steady, valuations remain reasonable and domestic institutions continue to provide support.\\\\nThe weeks ahead will reveal whether seasonal strength and selective corporate resilience are enough to lift the index closer to the long-absent 1,700 level, or whether foreign outflows will keep it anchored where it is.\\'}, {\\'headline\\': \\'Empowering Malaysians with financial protection\\', \\'published\\': datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 28, 8, 34), \\'source\\': \\'NST\\', \\'body\\': \\'KUALA LUMPUR: The life insurance landscape is evolving as households place greater emphasis on financial security and long-term protection.\\\\nRising awareness of life planning and wealth preservation is driving demand for solutions that can adapt to different life stages and provide stability in uncertain times.\\\\nFor Tokio Marine Life Insurance Malaysia Bhd (Tokio Marine Life), the evolving landscape presents an opportunity to build on its legacy of trust by offering life insurance solutions that are more comprehensive, relevant and accessible, while reinforcing its position as a leading life insurer in Malaysia.\\\\nChief executive officer Toi See Jong shared that Tokio Marine Life, with over 75 years of presence in Malaysia, is repositioning its business strategy around three pillars: strengthening strategic alliances, agency empowerment and digital integration, to build long-term resilience while addressing evolving customer needs.\\\\n\"As Malaysia\\\\\\'s life insurance landscape evolves, our mission remains steadfast in closing protection gaps and making insurance more relevant and accessible to all.

Interest expense slipped 0.7% in the quarter, while it recorded higher income from Islamic banking and sale of derivative financial instruments.

Net profit for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (3QFY2025) fell to RM28.21 million from RM86.88 million a year earlier, due to lower energy payments following a steam turbine pipe leakage at the Tanjung Bin Energy plant.

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of RHB Bank Berhad (1066.KL) over the past year reveals a positive risk-return profile suitable for a moderate investor. The stock has demonstrated a solid annualized return of 18.41%, coupled with manageable volatility. The Sharpe ratio of 0.86 indicates a good level of risk-adjusted return compared to the risk-free rate of 5%. The maximum drawdown of -11.16% suggests limited downside risk. Average daily trading volume is healthy at 6,885,408 shares.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 18.41% - This return is attractive for a moderate investor seeking growth.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.86 - This indicates favorable risk-adjusted returns relative to the risk-free rate.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown...\\n\\n**Round 2** [BUY, 70%]:\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I disagree with the Sentiment agent\\'s HOLD recommendation. While I acknowledge the importance of market sentiment, my valuation analysis suggests that RHB Bank Berhad presents an attractive risk-return profile, particularly for a moderate investor. The Sentiment agent highlights moderately positive sentiment, which I view as a supportive factor rather than a primary driver of investment decisions. The fundamental concerns raised by the Fundamental agent, and echoed by the Sentiment agent, warrant consideration, but the bank\\'s strong annualized return and Sharpe ratio, as highlighted in my initial analysis, still make it an attractive investment.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My analysis focuses on quantifiable metrics such as annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, ...\\n\\n**Round 3** [BUY, 65%]:\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I disagree with the Sentiment agent\\'s HOLD recommendation. While I acknowledge the validity of the Fundamental agent\\'s concerns regarding gross margin and asset quality, I believe the current risk-reward profile, based on valuation metrics, still leans towards a BUY for a moderate investor. The Sentiment agent\\'s moderately positive sentiment aligns with my view that the market isn\\'t overly bearish, which provides a degree of support. However, I place more emphasis on the quantifiable metrics that demonstrate the bank\\'s performance.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My analysis adds a crucial perspective by focusing on the historical performance and risk-adjusted returns.

While I acknowledge the validity of the Fundamental agent\\'s concerns, and the Sentiment agent\\'s agreement with those concerns, I still believe the risk-reward profile, based on historical valuation metrics, leans towards a BUY for a moderate investor, albeit with slightly reduced confidence. The Sentiment agent\\'s moderately positive sentiment, while not a strong buy signal, does provide some reassurance. However, I believe the historical performance, as reflected in the annualized return and Sharpe ratio, still warrants a slightly more optimistic outlook than a HOLD.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My analysis adds a crucial perspective by focusing on the historical performance and risk-adjusted returns....\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe SENTIMENT Agent just provided this analysis:\\n\\n---\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: I agree with the Fundamental agent\\'s continued HOLD recommendation. The agent\\'s concerns about gross margin and asset quality remain valid, and my sentiment analysis doesn\\'t outweigh these fundamental concerns.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My sentiment analysis provides a broader view of market perception, which can act as an early warning system for potential shifts in investor confidence.\\n\\n    Over the past week, the sentiment surrounding RHB Bank has been predominantly positive. Out of 38 articles analyzed, approximately 71% exhibit positive sentiment, 16% are neutral, and 13% are negative. This indicates a generally favorable market perception of the bank.\\n\\n    Key positive headlines include:\\n    *   \"RHB Bank announces record quarterly net profit of RM904mil in 3Q\"\\n    *   \"Banks expected to enter 2026 on firmer ground\"\\n    *   \"Higher total income buoys RHB Bank showing\"\\n\\n    However, there are also some negative headlines to consider:\\n    *   \"Heavy foreign outflows signal local equity market’s weakness\" (mentions RHB but in the context of broader market trends)\\n    *   \"FBM KLCI stays in the red at midday amid broad-based selling\" (mentions banking stocks generally)\\n\\n    A significant event was RHB Bank ceasing to be a substantial shareholder in Vantris Energy. While the immediate sentiment impact is neutral, the long-term implications of this strategic shift should be monitored.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: I maintain my HOLD recommendation with 70% confidence. The recent news flow is largely positive, driven by strong earnings and a generally optimistic outlook for the banking sector. However, the Fundamental agent\\'s concerns about gross margin and asset quality, combined with the potential risks highlighted in some negative articles, warrant a cautious approach for a moderate investor.\\n---\\n\\n**CRITICAL: You MUST start your response with this EXACT structured header format:**\\n```\\n[DECISION]\\nRECOMMENDATION: <BUY or HOLD or SELL>\\nCONFIDENCE: <number from 0 to 100>%\\n[/DECISION]\\n```\\n\\nAfter the structured header, provide your response.\\n\\nFrom your valuation analysis perspective, respond to their assessment:\\n\\n1. **Agreement/Disagreement**: Do you agree with their recommendation?

While I acknowledge the positive sentiment surrounding RHB Bank due to strong earnings and a generally optimistic outlook for the banking sector, I believe the historical performance metrics still support a BUY recommendation for a moderate investor. The positive sentiment reinforces my view that the market isn't overly bearish on RHB, which provides a degree of support to my valuation-based recommendation.\\n\\n2. **Additional Insights**: My analysis focuses on the quantifiable risk-adjusted return metrics derived from historical price data, which provides a different perspective compared to sentiment analysis. The Sentiment agent's analysis, while valuable, is more qualitative and focuses on market perception. My previous analysis highlighted an annualized return of 18.41% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.86, indicating a favorable risk-reward profile. While fundamental concerns about gross margin and asset quality are valid, the recent positive sentiment, combined with the bank's historical performance, suggests that these concerns may be already priced into the stock. Furthermore, the positive sentiment could potentially drive further price appreciation.\\n\\n3. **Updated Assessment**: I maintain my BUY recommendation with 60% confidence. The Sentiment agent's analysis strengthens my conviction that the market sentiment is supportive of RHB Bank.

The Valuation agent's analysis highlights a moderate risk-return profile, which aligns with my understanding of MISC Berhad as a company in a cyclical industry. The annualized return of 8.57% is reasonable, but the volatility of 17.33% and a low Sharpe ratio of 0.21 suggest that the risk-adjusted return isn't particularly compelling for a moderate investor.\\n\\n2.  **Additional Insights**: My fundamental analysis provides additional context regarding the drivers behind these returns and risks. While the Valuation agent focuses on historical price movements, my analysis considers the underlying business fundamentals.

Approximately 55% of articles exhibit positive sentiment, 30% are neutral, and 15% are negative.\\n   - Key themes: Positive sentiment is driven by news related to infrastructure projects and potential growth in its utilities and construction segments. Neutral articles primarily cover factual reporting on financial results and project updates. Negative sentiment stems from concerns about rising costs and potential delays in some projects.\\n   - Notable news events: A significant positive driver appears to be related to announcements regarding progress in renewable energy initiatives.\\n   - Sentiment trend: The sentiment trend appears relatively stable over the past week, with a slight uptick in positive sentiment due to the renewable energy news.\\n\\n2. **Key Supporting Evidence**:\\n   - Positive Sentiment Proportion: 55% of articles expressing positive sentiment suggests a generally favorable market perception.\\n   - Renewable Energy News: Articles highlighting YTL's advancements in renewable energy projects have generated positive sentiment, aligning with sustainable investment trends.\\n   - Stable Sentiment Trend: The stable sentiment trend indicates consistent market confidence, reducing concerns about sudden negative shifts.\\n   - Moderate Negative Sentiment: The relatively low proportion of negative articles (15%) suggests limited immediate risks based on news sentiment.\\n\\n3. **Sentiment Risks**:\\n   - Project Delays: Monitor news related to potential delays in major infrastructure projects, as this could trigger negative sentiment.\\n   - Rising Costs: Keep an eye on articles discussing rising construction or operational costs, which could impact profitability and investor confidence.\\n   - Market Volatility: Be aware of broader market volatility, which can amplify sentiment swings, especially given YTL's involvement in cyclical sectors like construction.\\n   - Geopolitical Risks: Given YTL's international presence, geopolitical events and policy changes in relevant regions could impact sentiment.\\n\\n**Recommendation Rationale for Moderate Investor:**\\n\\nGiven the moderate positive sentiment, stable trend, and the investor's risk profile, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate. The positive sentiment driven by renewable energy initiatives and infrastructure projects provides some upside potential. However, the presence of negative sentiment related to potential project delays and rising costs warrants caution. A moderate investor should monitor these risks closely before considering increasing their position. The 75% confidence reflects the consistent sentiment trend and the availability of a reasonable number of recent articles.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86dd-c4ed-7bb3-8497-c301f538771d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1578, 'output_tokens': 541, 'total_tokens': 2119, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of YTL Corporation Berhad (4677.KL) over the past year reveals a mixed risk-return profile. The stock has generated a modest annualized return of 7.08%. However, it exhibits significant volatility, with an annualized volatility of 44.56%. The Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is quite low at 0.047, indicating that the returns are not particularly attractive relative to the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -36.86% suggests a substantial potential for losses during adverse market conditions. The average daily volume is 18,748,867 shares, indicating reasonable liquidity.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 7.08% - Shows a positive return, but moderate.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 44.56% - Indicates high price swings and risk.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.047 - Very low, suggesting poor risk-adjusted return.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -36.86% - Highlights the potential for significant losses.\\n*   **Value at Risk (5%):** -3.68% - Suggests a moderate potential loss in a given day.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the primary risks associated with YTL Corporation Berhad are:\\n\\n*   **High Volatility:** The high annualized volatility of 44.56% means the stock's price can fluctuate significantly, which could lead to anxiety and potential losses.\\n*   **Significant Drawdown Potential:** The maximum drawdown of -36.86% indicates a considerable risk of substantial losses during market downturns. This is a critical concern for a moderate investor who seeks to avoid large losses.\\n*   **Low Sharpe Ratio:** The low Sharpe ratio of 0.047 suggests that the stock's returns do not adequately compensate for the level of risk involved. This is a concern as the investor seeks a balance between risk and return.\\n\\n**Recommendation Rationale:**\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor's profile, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate. While the stock has shown positive returns, the high volatility and significant drawdown potential are concerning. The low Sharpe ratio suggests that better risk-adjusted opportunities may exist elsewhere. The investor should closely monitor the stock's performance and consider reallocating if the risk profile does not align with their tolerance.\\n```\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86dd-e466-7741-b632-90cb09a832dd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1583, 'output_tokens': 572, 'total_tokens': 2155, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}}\n",

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of YTL Corporation Berhad (4677.KL) over the past year reveals a mixed risk-return profile. The stock has generated a modest annualized return of 7.08%. However, it exhibits significant volatility, with an annualized volatility of 44.56%. The Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return, is quite low at 0.047, indicating that the returns are not particularly attractive relative to the risk taken. The maximum drawdown of -36.86% suggests a substantial potential for losses during adverse market conditions. The average daily volume is 18,748,867 shares, indicating reasonable liquidity.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 7.08% - Shows a positive return, but moderate.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 44.56% - Indicates high price swings and risk.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.047 - Very low, suggesting poor risk-adjusted return.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -36.86% - Highlights the potential for significant losses.\\n*   **Value at Risk (5%):** -3.68% - Suggests a moderate potential loss in a given day.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the primary risks associated with YTL Corporation Berhad are:\\n\\n*   **High Volatility:** The high annualized volatility of 44.56% means the stock's price can fluctuate significantly, which could lead to anxiety and potential losses.\\n*   **Significant Drawdown Potential:** The maximum drawdown of -36.86% indicates a considerable risk of substantial losses during market downturns. This is a critical concern for a moderate investor who seeks to avoid large losses.\\n*   **Low Sharpe Ratio:** The low Sharpe ratio of 0.047 suggests that the stock's returns do not adequately compensate for the level of risk involved. This is a concern as the investor seeks a balance between risk and return.\\n\\n**Recommendation Rationale:**\\n\\nGiven the moderate investor's profile, a HOLD recommendation is appropriate. While the stock has shown positive returns, the high volatility and significant drawdown potential are concerning. The low Sharpe ratio suggests that better risk-adjusted opportunities may exist elsewhere. The investor should closely monitor the stock's performance and consider reallocating if the risk profile does not align with their tolerance.\\n```\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86dd-e466-7741-b632-90cb09a832dd-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1583, 'output_tokens': 572, 'total_tokens': 2155, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of NESTLE (Malaysia) Berhad (4707.KL) over the past year reveals a mixed risk-return profile. The stock has delivered a substantial annualized return of 28.16%. However, it also exhibits considerable volatility, with an annualized volatility of 30.69%. The Sharpe ratio, at 0.75, indicates a reasonable risk-adjusted return, but not exceptionally high. The maximum drawdown of -37.76% suggests significant potential downside risk. Average daily trading volume is 113,500 shares, with a recent volume of 222,000 shares, indicating increased investor interest.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 28.16% - Demonstrates strong price appreciation over the past year.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 30.69% - Indicates a relatively high level of price fluctuation.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.75 - Suggests an acceptable level of risk-adjusted return, given the volatility.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -37.76% - Highlights the potential for significant losses during market downturns.\\n*   **Average Volume:** 113,500 - Shows reasonable liquidity.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the key risks associated with NESTLE (Malaysia) Berhad (4707.KL) are:\\n\\n*   **High Volatility:** The annualized volatility of 30.69% means the stock's price can fluctuate significantly, which might be unsettling for a moderate investor.\\n*   **Significant Drawdown Risk:** The maximum drawdown of -37.76% indicates a substantial potential for losses during adverse market conditions. This is a critical risk that the investor should be aware of.\\n*   **Market Conditions:** External market factors and economic conditions can impact the stock's performance, leading to potential losses.\\n\\nGiven the moderate risk tolerance of the investor, the high volatility and significant drawdown risk warrant a HOLD recommendation.

Key Findings:**\\n\\nThe analysis of NESTLE (Malaysia) Berhad (4707.KL) over the past year reveals a mixed risk-return profile. The stock has delivered a substantial annualized return of 28.16%. However, it also exhibits considerable volatility, with an annualized volatility of 30.69%. The Sharpe ratio, at 0.75, indicates a reasonable risk-adjusted return, but not exceptionally high. The maximum drawdown of -37.76% suggests significant potential downside risk. Average daily trading volume is 113,500 shares, with a recent volume of 222,000 shares, indicating increased investor interest.\\n\\n**2. Key Supporting Evidence:**\\n\\n*   **Annualized Return:** 28.16% - Demonstrates strong price appreciation over the past year.\\n*   **Annualized Volatility:** 30.69% - Indicates a relatively high level of price fluctuation.\\n*   **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.75 - Suggests an acceptable level of risk-adjusted return, given the volatility.\\n*   **Maximum Drawdown:** -37.76% - Highlights the potential for significant losses during market downturns.\\n*   **Average Volume:** 113,500 - Shows reasonable liquidity.\\n\\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\\n\\nFor a moderate investor, the key risks associated with NESTLE (Malaysia) Berhad (4707.KL) are:\\n\\n*   **High Volatility:** The annualized volatility of 30.69% means the stock's price can fluctuate significantly, which might be unsettling for a moderate investor.\\n*   **Significant Drawdown Risk:** The maximum drawdown of -37.76% indicates a substantial potential for losses during adverse market conditions. This is a critical risk that the investor should be aware of.\\n*   **Market Conditions:** External market factors and economic conditions can impact the stock's performance, leading to potential losses.\\n\\nGiven the moderate risk tolerance of the investor, the high volatility and significant drawdown risk warrant a HOLD recommendation. While the returns are attractive, the potential for substantial losses should be carefully considered.\\n```\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'grounding_metadata': {}, 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b86de-7124-7e71-8352-7d15fe688f48-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1588, 'output_tokens': 518, 'total_tokens': 2106, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}\n",
